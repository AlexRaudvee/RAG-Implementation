Inspired by living creatures, it jumps across different terrains in an agile and energy-efficient manner.Share:FacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedINEmailFULL STORYInventors and researchers have been developing robots for almost 70 years. To date, all the machines they have built -- whether for factories or elsewhere -- have had one thing in common: they are powered by motors, a technology that is already 200 years old. Even walking robots feature arms and legs that are powered by motors, not by muscles as in humans and animals. This in part suggests why they lack the mobility and adaptability of living creatures.A new muscle-powered robotic leg is not only more energy efficient than a conventional one, it can also perform high jumps and fast movements as well as detect and react to obstacles -- all without the need for complex sensors. The new leg has been developed by researchers at ETH Zurich and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS) in a research partnership called Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems, known as CLS. The CLS team was led by Robert Katzschmann at ETH Zurich and Christoph Keplinger at MPI-IS. Their doctoral students Thomas Buchner and Toshihiko Fukushima are the co-first authors of the team\\'s publication on an animal-inspired musculoskeletal robotic leg in Nature Communications.Electrically charged like a balloonAs in humans and animals, an extensor and a flexor muscle ensure that the robotic leg can move in both directions. These electro-hydraulic actuators, which the researchers call HASELs, are attached to the skeleton by tendons.The actuators are oil-filled plastic bags, similar to those used to make ice cubes. About half of each bag is coated on either side with a black electrode made of a conductive material. Buchner explains that \"as soon as we apply a voltage to the electrodes, they are attracted to each other due to static electricity. Similarly, when I rub a balloon against my head, my hair sticks to the balloon due to the same static electricity.\" As one increases the voltage, the electrodes come closer and push the oil in the bag to one side, making the bag overall shorter.Pairs of these actuators attached to a skeleton result in the same paired muscle movements as in living creatures: as one muscle shortens, its counterpart lengthens. The researchers use a computer code that communicates with high-voltage amplifiers to control which actuators contract, and which extend.More efficient than electric motorsThe researchers compared the energy efficiency of their robotic leg with that of a conventional robotic leg powered by an electric motor. Among other things, they analysed how much energy is unnecessarily converted into heat. \"On the infrared image, it\\'s easy to see that the motorised leg consumes much more energy if, say, it has to hold a bent position,\" Buchner says. The temperature in the electro-hydraulic leg, in contrast, remains the same. This is because the artificial muscle is electrostatic. \"It\\'s like the example with the balloon and the hair, where the hair stays stuck to the balloon for quite a long time,\" Buchner adds. \"Typically, electric motor driven robots need heat management which requires additional heat sinks or fans for diffusing the heat to the air. Our system doesn\\'t require them,\" Fukushima says.Agile movement over uneven terrainThe robotic leg\\'s ability to jump is based on its ability to lift its own weight explosively. The researchers also showed that the robotic leg has a high degree of adaptability, which is particularly important for soft robotics. Only if the musculoskeletal system has sufficient elasticity can it adapt flexibly to the terrain in question. \"It\\'s no different with living creatures. If we can\\'t bend our knees, for example, walking on an uneven surface becomes much more difficult,\" Katzschmann says. \"Just think of taking a step down from the pavement onto the road.\"In contrast to electric motors requiring sensors to constantly tell what angle the robotic leg is at, the artificial muscle adapts to suitable position through the interaction with the environment. This is driven just by two input signals: one to bend the joint and one to extend it. Fukushima explains: \"Adapting to the terrain is a key aspect. When a person lands after jumping into the air, they don\\'t have to think in advance about whether they should bend their knees at a 90-degree or a 70-degree angle.\" The same principle applies to the robotic leg\\'s musculoskeletal system: upon landing, the leg joint adaptively moves into a suitable angle depending on whether the surface is hard or soft.Emerging technology opens up new possibilitiesThe research field of electrohydraulic actuators is still young, having emerged only around six years ago. \"The field of robotics is making rapid progress with advanced controls and machine learning; in contrast, there has been much less progress with robotic hardware, which is equally important. This publication is a powerful reminder of how much potential for disruptive innovation comes from introducing new hardware concepts, like the use of artificial muscles,\" Keplinger says. Katzschmann adds that electro-hydraulic actuators are unlikely to be used in heavy machinery on construction sites, but they do offer specific advantages over standard electric motors. This is particularly evident in applications such as grippers, where the movements have to be highly customised depending on whether the object being gripped is, for example, a ball, an egg or a tomato.Katzschmann does have one reservation: \"Compared to walking robots with electric motors, our system is still limited. The leg is currently attached to a rod, jumps in circles and can\\'t yet move freely.\" Future work should overcome these limitations, opening the door to developing real walking robots with artificial muscles. He further elaborates: \"If we combine the robotic leg in a quadruped robot or a humanoid robot with two legs, maybe one day, when it is battery-powered, we can deploy it as a rescue robot.\"RELATED TOPICSMatter & EnergyRobotics ResearchEnergy TechnologyEngineeringElectricityComputers & MathRoboticsArtificial IntelligenceNeural InterfacesComputer ScienceRELATED TERMSMachineTissue engineeringLightingConcordePac-ManRobotic surgeryAlgaeEnergyStory Source:Materialsprovided byETH Zurich.

However, these findings suggest that developers should avoid designing agents as overly human-like.Senior author Dr Nejra van Zalk, also from Imperial\\'s Dyson School of Design Engineering, said: \"A small but increasing body of research shows conflicting findings regarding whether humans treat AI virtual agents as social beings. This raises important questions about how people perceive and interact with these agents.\"Our results show that participants tended to treat AI virtual agents as social beings, because they tried to include them into the ball-tossing game if they felt the AI was being excluded. This is common in human-to-human interactions, and our participants showed the same tendency even though they knew they were tossing a ball to a virtual agent. Interestingly this effect was stronger in the older participants.\"People don\\'t like ostracism -- even toward AIFeeling empathy and taking corrective action against unfairness is something most humans appear hardwired to do. Prior studies not involving AI found that people tended to compensate ostracised targets by tossing the ball to them more frequently, and that people also tended to dislike the perpetrator of exclusionary behaviour while feeling preference and sympathy towards the target.To carry out the study, the researchers looked at how 244 human participants responded when they observed an AI virtual agent being excluded from play by another human in a game called \\'Cyberball\\', in which players pass a virtual ball to each other on-screen. The participants were aged between 18 and 62.In some games, the non-participant human threw the ball a fair number of times to the bot, and in others, the non-participant human blatantly excluded the bot by throwing the ball only to the participant.Participants were observed and subsequently surveyed for their reactions to test whether they favoured throwing the ball to the bot after it was treated unfairly, and why.They found that most of the time, the participants tried to rectify the unfairness towards the bot by favouring throwing the ball to the bot. Older participants were more likely to perceive unfairness.Human cautionThe researchers say that as AI virtual agents become more popular in collaborative tasks, increased engagement with humans could increase our familiarity and trigger automatic processing. This would mean users would likely intuitively include virtual agents as real team members and engage with them socially.This, they say, can be an advantage for work collaboration but might be concerning where virtual agents are used as friends to replace human relationships, or as advisors on physical or mental health.Jianan said: \"By avoiding designing overly human-like agents, developers could help people distinguish between virtual and real interaction. They could also tailor their design for specific age ranges, for example, by accounting for how our varying human characteristics affect our perception.\"The researchers point out that Cyberball might not represent how humans interact in real-life scenarios, which typically occur through written or spoken language with chatbots or voice assistants. This might have conflicted with some participants\\' user expectations and raised feelings of strangeness, affecting their responses during the experiment.Therefore, they are now designing similar experiments using face-to-face conversations with agents in varying contexts such as in the lab or more casual settings. This way, they can test how far their findings extend.RELATED TOPICSMind & BrainSocial PsychologyPsychologyBrain-Computer InterfacesMatter & EnergyVirtual EnvironmentSports ScienceEngineeringComputers & MathVirtual RealityVideo GamesArtificial IntelligenceScience & SocietySportsSTEM EducationBioethicsRELATED TERMS3D computer graphicsPassive infrared sensorsBrainPerfectionism (psychology)Fluid dynamicsMacroeconomicsAcousticsComputer and video gamesStory Source:Materialsprovided byImperial College London.

But that low-key release changed everything.By January, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing web app ever, offering anyone with a browser access to one of the most powerful neural networks ever built. We were dazzled and disturbed.And that was only the start. In February, Microsoft and Google revealed rival plans tocombine chatbots with search—plans that reimagined our daily interactions with the internet.Early demos weren’t great. Microsoft’s Bing Chat went off the rails, quick to churn out nonsense. Google’s Bard was caught making a factual error in its promo pitch. But the genie wasn’t going back in its bottle, no matter how weird it was.Related StoryThese six questions will dictate the future of generative AIGenerative AI took the world by storm in 2023. Its future—and ours—will be shaped by what we do next.Microsoft and Google have since moved beyond search to put chatbot-based assistants into the hands of billions of people via their office software. The tech promises to summarize emails and meetings; draft reports and replies; generate whole slide decks—titles, bullet points, and pictures—in seconds.Microsoft and Meta released image-making models that let users generate shareable images of anything with a click. Cue a nonstop stream of zany mash-ups—and dozens of posts about Mickey Mouse and SpongeBob SquarePants flying a plane into the Twin Towers.Google’s new phones now use AI to let you edit photos to a degree never seen before, exchanging sad faces for happy ones and overcast afternoons for perfect sunsets.Never has such radical new technology gone from experimental prototype to consumer product so fast and at such scale. What’s clear is that we haven’t even begun to make sense of it all, let alonereckon with its impact.Is the shine coming off? Maybe. Witheach release, the astonishing becomes more mundane. But 2023’s legacy is clear: billions have looked AI in the face. Now we need to figure out exactly what’s looking back.202410 Breakthrough TechnologieshidebyWill Douglas HeavenShareShare story on linkedinShare story on facebookShare story on emailPopularPeople are using Google study software to make AI podcasts—and they’re weird and amazingMelissa HeikkiläThis AI-generated version of Minecraft may represent the future of real-time video generationScott J MulliganWhy AI could eat quantum computing’s lunchEdd GentAI can now create a replica of your personalityJames O'DonnellDeep DiveArtificial intelligencePeople are using Google study software to make AI podcasts—and they’re weird and amazingNotebookLM is a surprise hit.
