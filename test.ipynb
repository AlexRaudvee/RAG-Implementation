Having wonthe 2024 presidential electionas the nominee of the Republican Party, he is scheduled to beinaugurated as the 47th presidenton January\\xa020, 2025.Trump graduated with abachelor\\'s degreein economics from theUniversity of Pennsylvaniain 1968. After becoming president of the family real estate business in 1971, he renamed itthe Trump Organization. After a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s helaunched side ventures, mostly by licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he produced and hosted the reality television seriesThe Apprentice.Trump won the2016 presidential electionas theRepublican Partynominee while losing the popular vote.[a]His election and policiessparked numerous protests. Inhis first term, he ordereda travel bantargeting several Muslim-majority countries, expanded the U.S.â€“Mexico border wall, and implementeda family separation policyat that border. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations, signed theTax Cuts and Jobs Actof 2017, and appointed three justices to the Supreme Court. He initiated a trade war with China in 2018, withdrew the U.S. from several international agreements, and met with North Korean leaderKim Jong Unwithout progress on denuclearization. In response tothe COVID-19 pandemic, he signed theCARES Acteconomic stimulus in 2020, publicly downplayed the crisis\\'s severity, ignored recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread unverified information about unproven treatments. He was impeachedin 2019for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, andin 2021for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him in both cases.Trump\\'s politics and rhetoric led to the creation of theTrumpismmovement. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, and misogynistic. Hepromoted conspiracy theoriesandmade many false and misleading statementsduring his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. After his first term,scholars and historians ranked himas one of the worst presidents in American history. He lostthe 2020 presidential election, but did not concede, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud andattempting to overturn the results, including his involvement inthe January\\xa06 Capitol attack. In 2024,he was found guilty of falsifying business records, making him the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. He facedmore felony indictmentsrelated to his interference in the 2020 election andhis handling of classified documents, which were dismissed after the 2024 election.Early life and educationTrump atNew York Military Academy, 1964Trump was born on June\\xa014, 1946, atJamaica HospitalinQueens, New York City, the fourth child ofFred TrumpandMary Anne MacLeod Trump.[1]He is of German and Scottish descent.[2]He grew up with his older siblings,Maryanne,Fred Jr., and Elizabeth, and his younger brother,Robert, in a mansion in theJamaica Estatesneighborhood of Queens.[3]He attended the privateKew-Forest Schoolthrough seventh grade[4]andNew York Military Academy, a private boarding school, from eighth through twelfth grade.[5][6]In 1964, Trump enrolled atFordham University. Two years later, he transferred to theWharton Schoolof theUniversity of Pennsylvania,[7]graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.[8]In 2015, he threatened his high school, colleges, and theCollege Boardwith legal action if they released his academic records.[9]Personal lifeFurther information:Family of Donald TrumpFamilyIn 1977, Trump married the Czech modelIvana ZelnÃ\\xadÄ�kovÃ¡.[10]They had three children:Donald Jr.(1977â€“),Ivanka(1981â€“), andEric(1984â€“). The couple divorced in 1990, following his affair with the actressMarla Maples.[11]He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter,Tiffany(1993â€“), whom Maples raised in California.[12]In 2005, he married the Slovenian modelMelania Knauss.[13]They have one son,Barron(2006â€“).[14]HealthTrump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs.[15][16]He sleeps about four or five hours a night.[17][18]He has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\", but usually does not walk the course.[19]He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\", which is depleted by exercise.[20][21]In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician,Harold Bornstein, stating that he would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[22]In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump\\'s agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on Bornsteinâ€™s office.[22][23]ViewsMany of Trump\\'s comments and actions have beendescribed as racist.[24]In national polling, about half of respondents said that he is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[25]Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled his political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[26]Racist andIslamophobicattitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.[27]He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated in 2002 when the actual rapist confessed and his DNA matched the evidence. In October 2024, the men sued Trump for defamation after he said in a televised September debate that they had committed the crime and killed the woman.[28]In 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, Trump became the leading proponent of the racist\"birther\" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the U.S.[29]In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him \"very popular\".[30]In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[31]In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views privately.[32]Answering questions about the Unite the Right rally in CharlottesvilleTrump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media.[33][34]He made lewd comments, disparaged women\\'s physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[34]At least 25 women publiclyaccused him of sexual misconduct, including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women\\'s skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. He has denied the allegations.[35]In October 2016, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in whichTrump braggedabout kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that \"when you\\'re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab \\'em by thepussy.\"[36]The incident\\'s widespread media exposure led to Trump\\'s first public apology during his 2016 presidential campaign[37]and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[38]Business careerMain article:Business career of Donald TrumpFurther information:Business projects of Donald Trump in RussiaandTax returns of Donald TrumpReal estateTrump in 1985 with a model of one of his aborted Manhattan development projects[39]Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father\\'s real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City\\'s outer boroughs.[40][41]In 1971, his father made him president of the company and he began using theTrump Organizationas anumbrella brand.[42]In 1975, Trumpsettled a 1973 Department of Justice civil rights lawsuitalleging housing discrimination against black renters by consenting to desegregate.[43]Between 1991 and 2009, he filed forChapter 11bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: thePlaza Hotelin Manhattan, the casinos inAtlantic City, New Jersey, and theTrump Hotels & Casino Resortscompany.[44]Manhattan and Chicago developmentsTrump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family\\'s first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelictCommodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[45]The financing was facilitated by a $400\\xa0million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly withHyatt, guaranteed a $70\\xa0million bank construction loan.[41][46]The hotel reopened in 1980 as theGrand Hyatt Hotel,[47]and that same year, he obtained rights to developTrump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[48]The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump\\'sPACand was his primary residence until 2019.[49][50]In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of sixteen banks.[51]The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[52]In 1995, he defaulted on over $3\\xa0billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a \"vast and humiliating restructuring\" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy.[53][54]The lead bank\\'s attorney said of the banks\\' decision that they \"all agreed that he\\'d be better alive than dead\".[53]In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building.[55]In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28\\xa0ha) tract in theLincoln Squareneighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project\\'s completion,Riverside South.[56]Trump\\'s last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-useTrump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)which opened in 2008. In 2024, theNew York Times and ProPublica reportedthat the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return.[57][58]Atlantic City casinosEntrance of theTrump Taj MahalinAtlantic CityIn 1984, Trump openedHarrah\\'s at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from theHoliday Corporation.[59]It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70\\xa0million in May 1986 to take sole control.[60]In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed itTrump Castle.[61]Both casinos filed forChapter 11bankruptcy protection in 1992.[62]Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, theTrump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675\\xa0million injunk bondsand completed for $1.1\\xa0billion, opening in April 1990.[63][64]He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[65]To reduce his $900\\xa0million of personal debt, he sold theTrump Shuttleairline; his megayacht, theTrump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[66]In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[67]THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10\\xa0percent ownership.[59]He remained chairman until 2009.[68]ClubsIn 1985, Trump acquired theMar-a-Lagoestate in Palm Beach, Florida.[69]In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[70]He declared the club his primary residence in 2019.[50]The Trump Organization beganbuilding and buying golf coursesin 1999.[71]It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide.[71][72]Side venturesSee also:List of things named after Donald TrumpThe Trump Organizationhas licensed the Trump name for consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, learning courses, and home furnishings.[73][74]According toThe Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving his name, and they have generated at least $59\\xa0million in revenue for his companies.[75]By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[73]Trump and New Jersey Generals quarterbackDoug Flutieat a 1985 press conference in Trump TowerIn September 1983, Trump purchased theNew Jersey Generals, a team in theUnited States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to his attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with theNFLfor audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit.[76][77]Trump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at theAtlantic City Convention Hall.[59][78]In 1989 and 1990, he lent his name to theTour de Trumpcycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as theTour de Franceor theGiro d\\'Italia.[79]From 1986 to 1988, Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[80]leading some observers to think he was engaged ingreenmail.[81]The New York Timesfound that he initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but \"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\".[80]In 1988, Trump purchased theEastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380\\xa0million (equivalent to $979\\xa0million in 2023)[82]in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airlineTrump Shuttleand operated it until 1992.[83]He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[84]In 1992, Trump, his siblingsMaryanne, Elizabeth, andRobert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20\\xa0percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump\\'s rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20â€“50\\xa0percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups.[85][86]The increased costs were used to get state approval for increasing the rents of his rent-stabilized units.[85]From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned all or part of theMiss Universepageants, includingMiss USAandMiss Teen USA.[87][88]Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[89][90]In 2007, he received a star on theHollywood Walk of Famefor his work as producer of Miss Universe.[91]NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015.[92]Trump UniversityMain article:Trump UniversityIn 2004, Trump co-foundedTrump University, a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000.[93]After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of \"university\" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[94]In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40\\xa0million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[95]Additionally, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[96][97][98]Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, he agreed to pay a total of $25\\xa0million to settle the three cases.[99]FoundationMain article:Donald J. Trump FoundationThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was aprivate foundationestablished in 1988.[100][101]From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4\\xa0million which had been spent by the end of 2006. After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007â€“2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity,[102]which received millions from other donors, including $5\\xa0million fromVince McMahon.[103]The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups,[104]and charities that held events at Trump properties.[102]In 2016,The Washington Postreported that the charity committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possibletax evasion.[105]Also in 2016, the New York attorney general determined the foundation to be in violation of state law, for soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits, and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately.[106]Trump\\'s team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[107]In June 2018, the New York attorney general\\'s office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8\\xa0million in restitution and additional penalties.[108]In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[109]In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2\\xa0million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation\\'s funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[110][111]Legal affairs and bankruptciesMain article:Personal and business legal affairs of Donald TrumpRoy Cohnwas Trump\\'sfixer, lawyer, and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[112]According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship.[112]In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100\\xa0million (equivalent to $686\\xa0million in 2023)[82]over its charges that Trump\\'s properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump\\'s counterclaims were dismissed, and the government\\'s case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate.[113]In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump\\'s properties to furnish theNew York Urban Leaguewith a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.[114]Cohn introduced political consultantRoger Stoneto Trump, who enlisted Stone\\'s services to deal with the federal government.[115]According to a review of state and federal court files conducted byUSA Todayin 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[116]While he has not filed forpersonal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed forChapter 11 bankruptcyprotection six times between 1991 and 2009.[117]They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties.[117]During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4\\xa0billion.[118]After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.[119]After theJanuary\\xa06 Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with him or his company in the future.[120]WealthMain article:Wealth of Donald TrumpTrump (rightmost) and wife Ivana in the receiving line of a state dinner for KingFahd of Saudi Arabiain 1985, with U.S. presidentRonald Reaganand First LadyNancy ReaganIn 1982, Trump made the initialForbeslist of wealthy people for holding a share of his family\\'s estimated $200\\xa0million net worth (equivalent to $631\\xa0million in 2023).[82]His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.[121]After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with theFECin July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10\\xa0billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4\\xa0billion in assets and $265\\xa0million in liabilities.[122]Forbesestimated his net worth dropped by $1.4\\xa0billion between 2015 and 2018.[123]In their 2024 billionaires ranking, his net worth was estimated to be $2.3\\xa0billion (1,438th in the world).[124]In 2018, journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported that Trump had called him in 1984 pretending to be a fictional Trump Organization official named \"John Barron\". Greenberg said that, to get a higher ranking on theForbes400list of wealthy Americans, Trump, speaking as \"Barron\", falsely asserted that Donald Trump owned more than 90\\xa0percent of his father\\'s business. Greenberg also wrote thatForbeshad vastly overestimated Trump\\'s wealth and wrongly included him on the 1982, 1983, and 1984 rankings.[125]Trump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of a million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[126]He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60\\xa0million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413\\xa0million (2018 dollars adjusted for inflation) from his father\\'s company.[127][85]In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and theNew York State Department of Taxation and Financestarted an investigation.[85]His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets.[128][129]Forbesestimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5\\xa0billion in 2015 to $3.1\\xa0billion in 2017 and his product-licensing income from $23\\xa0million to $3\\xa0million.[130]Trump\\'s tax returnsfrom 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17\\xa0billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250\\xa0million each year, were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7\\xa0million (equivalent to $1.83\\xa0billion in 2023).[80][131][82]In 2020,The New York Timesobtained Trump\\'s tax information extending over two decades. Its reporters found that he reported losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. Since 2010 he had also failed to pay back $287\\xa0million in loans. During the 15 years prior to 2020, usingtax creditsfor business losses, he paid no income taxes in 10 of those years and $750 each in 2016 and 2017. He balanced his businesses\\' losses by selling and borrowing against assets, including a $100\\xa0millionmortgage on Trump Tower (refinanced in 2022)and the liquidation of over $200\\xa0million in stocks and bonds. He personally guaranteed $421\\xa0million in debt, most of which is due by 2024.[132]As of October\\xa02021[update], Trump had over $1.3\\xa0billion in debts, much of which was secured by his assets.[133]In 2020, he owed $640\\xa0million to banks and trust organizations, includingBank of China,Deutsche Bank, andUBS, and approximately $450\\xa0million to unknown creditors. The value of his assets exceeds his debt.[134]Media careerMain article:Media career of Donald TrumpSee also:Bibliography of Donald TrumpTrump has produced 19 books under his name. At least most of them were written or co-written byghostwriters.[135]His first book,The Art of the Deal(1987), was aNew York TimesBest Seller. While he was credited as co-author, the entire book was written byTony Schwartz. According toThe New Yorker, the book made Trump famous as an \"emblem of the successful tycoon\".[136]Trump\\'s star on the Hollywood Walk of FameTrump had cameos in many films and television shows from 1985 to 2001.[137]Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicatedHoward Stern Show.[138]He had his own short-form talk radio program calledTrumped!from 2004 to 2008.[139][140]From 2011 until 2015, he was a guest commentator onFox & Friends.[141][142]From 2004 to 2015, Trump was co-producer and host of reality showsThe ApprenticeandThe Celebrity Apprentice. On the shows, he was a superrich and successful chief executive who eliminated contestants with thecatchphrase\"you\\'re fired\".The New York Timescalled his portrayal a \"highly flattering, highly fictionalized version of Mr. Trump\". The shows remade his image for millions of viewers nationwide.[143][144]With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400\\xa0million.[145]In February 2021, Trump, who had been a member ofSAG-AFTRAsince 1989, resigned to avoid a disciplinary hearing regarding the January\\xa06 attack.[146]Two days later, the union permanently barred him.[147]Early political aspirations (1987â€“2014)Further information:Political career of Donald TrumpTrump and PresidentBill Clinton, June 2000Trump registered as a Republican in 1987;[148]a member of theIndependence Party, the New York state affiliate of theReform Party, in 1999;[149]a Democrat in 2001; a Republican in 2009; unaffiliated in 2011; and a Republican in 2012.[148]Trump speaking atCPAC2011In 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in three major newspapers,[150]expressing his views on foreign policy and how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.[151]In 1988, he approachedLee Atwater, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nomineeGeorge H. W. Bush\\'s running mate. Bush found the request \"strange and unbelievable\".[152]Trumpwas a candidatein the2000 Reform Party presidential primariesfor three months, but withdrew from the race in February 2000.[153][154][155]In 2011, Trump speculated about running against President Barack Obama inthe 2012 election, making his first speaking appearance at theConservative Political Action Conference(CPAC) in February and giving speeches in early primary states.[156][157]In May, he announced he would not run.[156]His presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.[158]2016 presidential electionCampaignMain article:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaignFurther information:2016 Republican Party presidential primariesand2016 United States presidential election Â§\\xa0General election campaignTrump announced his candidacy in June 2015.[159][160]His campaignwas initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[161]He became the front-runner in March 2016[162]and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.[163]Trump\\'s fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount offree media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[164]He adopted the phrase \"truthful hyperbole\", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style.[136][165]His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,[166]and a record number were false.[167][168][169]He said he disdainedpolitical correctnessand frequently made claims ofmedia bias.[170][171]Trump campaigning in Arizona, March 2016Hillary Clintonled Trump innational polling averagesthroughout the campaign, but, in early July, her lead narrowed.[172]In mid-July he selected Indiana governorMike Penceas his running mate,[173]and the two were officially nominated at the2016 Republican National Convention.[174]Trump and Clinton faced off inthree presidential debatesin September and October 2016. He twice refused to say whether he would accept the result of the election.[175]Trump described NATO as \"obsolete\"[176][177]and espoused views that were described asnoninterventionistand protectionist.[178]His campaign platform emphasized renegotiatingU.S.â€“China relationsand free trade agreements such asNAFTA, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and buildinga new wallalong theU.S.â€“Mexico border. Other campaign positions included pursuingenergy independencewhile opposing climate change regulations, modernizingservices for veterans, repealing and replacing theAffordable Care Act, abolishingCommon Coreeducation standards,investing in infrastructure, simplifying thetax codewhile reducing taxes, and imposingtariffson imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated increasing military spending and extreme vetting or banning of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries.[179]Trump\\'s proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter debate during the 2016 campaign. He promised to builda wallon theMexicoâ€“U.S. borderto restrict illegal movement and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[180]He pledged to deport millions ofillegal immigrants residing in the U.S.,[181]and criticizedbirthright citizenshipfor incentivizing \"anchor babies\".[182]According to an analysis inPolitical Science Quarterly, Trump made \"explicitly racist appeals to whites\" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[183]In particular, his campaign launch speech drew criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs, they\\'re bringing crime, they\\'re rapists\";[184]in response, NBC fired him fromCelebrity Apprentice.[185]His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regardingTrump Universitywere also criticized as racist.[186]Financial disclosuresFurther information:Tax returns of Donald TrumpTrump\\'s FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4\\xa0billion and outstanding debts of at least $315\\xa0million.[122][187]He did not releasehis tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.[188][189]He said his tax returns were beingaudited, and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[190]After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to theManhattan district attorneyfor a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to theU.S. Supreme Court, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.[191][192]In October 2016, portions of Trump\\'s state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter fromThe New York Times. They show that he had declared a loss of $916\\xa0million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.[193]ResultsMain article:2016 United States presidential electionOn November\\xa08, 2016, Trump received 306 pledgedelectoral votesversus 232 for Clinton, although, after electordefections on both sides, the official count was ultimately 304 to 227.[194]The fifth person to be elected presidentwhile losing the popular vote, he received nearly 2.9\\xa0million fewer votes than Clinton.[195]He was the only president who neither served in the military nor held any government office prior to becoming president.[196]Women\\'s Marchin Washington, D.C., on January\\xa021, 2017Trump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, states which had been considered ablue wallof Democratic strongholds since the 1990s.

It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals and set the penalty associated with theAffordable Care Act\\'s individual mandate to $0.[215][216]The Trump administration claimed that the act would not decrease government revenue, but 2018 revenues were 7.6\\xa0percent lower than projected.[217]Under Trump, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50\\xa0percent, to nearly $1\\xa0trillion in 2019.[218]By the end of his term, theU.S. national debtincreased by 39\\xa0percent, reaching $27.75\\xa0trillion, and the U.S.debt-to-GDP ratiohit a post-World War II high.[219]Trump also failed to deliver the $1\\xa0trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[220]Trump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3\\xa0million people.[213][221]Trump rejects thescientific consensus on climate change.[222][223][224][225]He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40\\xa0percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[226]Hewithdrew from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation to not ratify it.[227]Trump aimed to boost the production and exports offossil fuels.[228][229]Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[230][231]He rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbedgreenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowingdrilling in the Arctic Refuge.[232]In 2017, Trump signedExecutive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies \"identify\" two existing regulations for elimination, although it did not require elimination.[233]He dismantled many federal regulations on health,[234][235]labor,[236][235]and the environment,[237][235]among others, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[238]During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[239]often \"after requests by the regulated industries\".[240]TheInstitute for Policy Integrityfound that 78\\xa0percent of his proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[241]During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace theAffordable Care Act.[242]In office, he scaled back the Act\\'s implementation through executive orders.[243][244]He expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration halved theenrollment periodand drastically reduced funding for enrollment promotion.[245][246]In June 2018, the Trump administrationjoined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Courtthat the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the Act unconstitutional.[247][248]Their pleading would have eliminatedhealth insurance coveragefor up to 23\\xa0million Americans, but was unsuccessful.[247]During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs. In January 2020, he expressed willingness to consider cuts to them.[249]In response to theopioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a record 50,052 in 2019.[250]Trump barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.[251]He said he supported \"traditional marriage\", but considered thenationwide legalityofsame-sex marriage\"settled\".[252]His administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration\\'s workplace protections againstdiscrimination of LGBTQ people.[253]His attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections fortransgenderpatients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after a Supreme Court ruling extended employees\\' civil rights protections togender identityand sexual orientation.[254]Trump has said he isopposedtogun control, although his views have shifted over time.[255]After severalmass shootingsduring his term, he said he would propose legislation related to guns, but he abandoned that effort in November 2019.[256]His administration took ananti-marijuana position, revokingObama-era policiesthat provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.[257]Trump is a long-time advocate of capital punishment.[258][259]Under his administration, thefederal government executed13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined, ending a 17-year moratorium.[260]In 2016, he said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such aswaterboarding.[261][262]Race relationsTrump\\'s comments on the 2017Unite the Right rally, condemning \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\" and stating that there were \"very fine people on both sides\", were criticized as implying amoral equivalencebetween thewhite supremacistdemonstrators and the counter-protesters.[263]In a January 2018 discussion of immigration legislation, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\".[264]His remarks were condemned as racist.[265]In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomenâ€”all from minorities, three of whom are native-born Americansâ€”should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\".[266]Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240â€“187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\".[267]White nationalistpublications and social media praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[268]He continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.[269]Trump and group of officials and advisors on the way from the White House to St. John\\'s ChurchIn June 2020, during theGeorge Floyd protests, federal law-enforcement officials controversially usedless lethalweapons to remove a largely peaceful crowd of lawful protesters fromLafayette Square, outside theWhite House.[270][271]Trump then posed with a Bible fora photo-opat the nearbySt. John\\'s Episcopal Church,[270][272][273]with religious leaders condemning both the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[274]Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned his proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[275]Pardons and commutationsFurther information:List of people granted executive clemency by Donald TrumpTrump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception ofGeorge H. W. BushandGeorge W. Bush.[276]Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department\\'sOffice of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.[277][278]In his last full day in office, he granted 73 pardons and commuted 70 sentences.[279]Several Trump allies were not eligible for pardons under Justice Department rules, and in other cases the department had opposed clemency.[277]The pardons of three military service members convicted of or charged with violent crimes were opposed by military leaders.[280]ImmigrationMain article:Immigration policy of Donald TrumpAs president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gangMS-13.[281]Trump drastically escalated immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.[282][283]From 2018 onward, Trumpdeployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.â€“Mexico border[284]to stop most Central American migrants from seeking asylum. In 2020, his administration widened thepublic charge ruleto further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency.[285]He reduced the number ofrefugees admittedto record lows. When he took office, the annual limit was 110,000; he set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year.[286][287]Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted than the allowed limits.[288]Travel banMain article:Trump travel banFurther information:Executive Order 13769andExecutive Order 13780Following the2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump proposed to banMuslimforeigners from entering the U.S. until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[289]He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[290]On January\\xa027, 2017, Trump signedExecutive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning, causing chaos at airports.[291][292]Protests began at airportsthe next day,[291][292]andlegal challengesresulted innationwide preliminary injunctions.[293]A March\\xa06revised order, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, again was blocked by federal judges in three states.[294][295]In adecision in June 2017, theSupreme Courtruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of abona fiderelationship with a person or entity in the United States\".[296]The temporary order was replaced byPresidential Proclamation 9645on September\\xa024, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[297]After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December\\xa04, 2017,[298]and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a ruling in June 2019.[299]Family separation at the borderMain article:Trump administration family separation policyChildren sitting within a wire mesh compartment in theUrsula detention facilityinMcAllen, Texas, June 2018The Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.â€“Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[300][301]In April 2018, the administration announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy whereby adults suspected ofillegal entrywere to be detained and criminally prosecuted while their children were taken away as unaccompanied alien minors.[302][303]The policy was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage.[304][305]Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration\\'s policy.[306][307][308]Although Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he acceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order in June 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" of a risk to the child.[309][310]On June\\xa026, 2018, JudgeDana Sabrawconcluded that the Trump administration had \"no system in place to keep track of\" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification;[311]Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances.[312]After the order, the administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; theACLUcontended that the administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.[301]Trump wall and government shutdownMain articles:Trump walland2018â€“2019 United States federal government shutdownTrump examines border wall prototypes inOtay Mesa, California.One of Trump\\'s central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600\\xa0km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.[313]By the end of his term, the U.S. had built \"40 miles [64\\xa0km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53\\xa0km] of secondary wall\" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587\\xa0km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.[314]In 2018, Trump refused to sign anyappropriations billfrom Congress unless it allocated $5.6\\xa0billion for the border wall,[315]resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, thelongest U.S. government shutdown in history.[316][317]Around 800,000 government employees werefurloughedor worked without pay.[318]Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers, but no funds for the wall.[316]The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3\\xa0billion to the economy, according to theCongressional Budget Office.[319]About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and his approval ratings dropped.[320]To prevent another imminent shutdown in February 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a funding bill that included $1.375\\xa0billion for 55 miles (89\\xa0km) of bollard border fencing.[321]He also declared anational emergency on the southern border, intending to divert $6.1\\xa0billion of funds Congress had allocated to other purposes.[321]He vetoedajoint resolutionto overturn the declaration, and the Senate voted against aveto override.[322]Legal challenges to the diversion of $2.5\\xa0billion originally meant for theDepartment of Defense\\'s drug interdiction efforts[323][324]and $3.6\\xa0billion originally meant for military construction[325][326]were unsuccessful.Foreign policyMain article:Foreign policy of the first Donald Trump administrationSee also:List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump Â§\\xa0First presidency (2017â€“2021)Trump with the otherG7leaders at the45th summitin France, 2019Trump described himself as a \"nationalist\"[327]and his foreign policy as \"America First\".[328]He praised and supportedpopulist,neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments.[329]Hallmarks of foreign relations during his tenure included unpredictability, uncertainty, and inconsistency.[328][330]Tensions between the U.S. and its European allies were strained under Trump.[331]He criticizedNATO alliesand privately suggested on multiple occasions that the U.S. shouldwithdraw from NATO.[332][333]TradeSee also:Trump tariffsTrump withdrew the U.S. from theTrans-Pacific Partnership(TPP) negotiations,[334]imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[335]and launched atrade war with Chinaby sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50\\xa0billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[336]While he said that import tariffs are paid by China into theU.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.[337]Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.\\'s largetrade deficits, the trade deficit skyrocketed under Trump.[338]Following a 2017â€“2018 renegotiation, theUnited Statesâ€“Mexicoâ€“Canada Agreement(USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.[339]RussiaSee

toughest sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Russian entities after Russia\\'s2014 annexation of Crimea.[340][341]Trump withdrew the U.S. from theIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian noncompliance,[342]and supported a potential return of Russia to theG7.[343]Trump repeatedly praised and rarely criticized Russian presidentVladimir Putin[344][345]but opposed some actions of the Russian government.[346][347]After he met Putin at theHelsinki Summitin 2018, he drew bipartisan criticism for accepting Putin\\'s denial ofRussian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies.[348][349][350]He did not discuss allegedRussian bountiesoffered toTalibanfighters for attacking American soldiers in Afghanistan with Putin, saying both that he doubted the intelligence and that he was not briefed on it.[351]East AsiaChina, Hong Kong, TaiwanSee also:Chinaâ€“United States relations Â§\\xa0First Trump

war against Chinathat was widely characterized as a failure,[353][354]sanctionedHuaweifor alleged ties to Iran,[355]significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars,[356]and classified China as acurrency manipulator.[357]He also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise ofChinese Communist PartyleaderXi Jinping,[358]which was attributed to trade war negotiations.[359]After initially praising China forits handling of COVID-19,[360]he began a campaign of criticism starting in March 2020.[361]Trump said he resisted punishing China forits human rights abusesagainst ethnic minorities in theXinjiangregion for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations.[362]In July 2020,his administration imposed sanctionsand visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, in response to expanded massdetention campsholding more than a million of the country\\'sUyghurminority.[363]North KoreaSee also:North Koreaâ€“United States relations Â§\\xa0First

Korea\\'s nuclear weaponswere increasingly seen as a serious threat,[364]Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\".[365][366]In 2017, he declared that he wanted North Korea\\'s \"complete denuclearization\", and engaged inname-callingwith leaderKim Jong Un.[365][367]After this period of tension, he and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship.[368][369]In March 2019, he lifted some U.S.sanctions against North Koreaagainst the advice of his Treasury Department.[370]Trump, the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, met Kim three times:in Singaporein 2018,in Hanoiin 2019, andin the Korean Demilitarized Zonein 2019.[371]However, nodenuclearizationagreement was reached,[372]and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.[373]While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles.[374][375]Middle EastAfghanistanU.S. Secretary of StateMike Pompeomeeting with Taliban delegation inQatarin September 2020U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,[376]reversing Trump\\'s preelection position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[377]In February 2020, his administration signed apeace agreement with the Taliban, which called for thewithdrawal of foreign troopsin 14 months \"contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies\" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000Talibanimprisoned by the Afghan government.[378][379][380]By the end of his term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integratingAl-Qaedamembers into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.[380]IsraelTrump supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu.[381]Under Trump, the U.S.recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel[382]andIsraeli sovereigntyover theGolan Heights,[383]leading to international condemnation including from theUN General Assembly,European Union, andArab League.[384][385]In 2020, the White House hosted the signing of agreements, namedAbraham Accords, between Israel and theUnited Arab EmiratesandBahrainto normalize their foreign relations.[386]Saudi ArabiaTrump, KingSalman of Saudi Arabia, and Egyptian presidentAbdel Fattah el-Sisiat the2017 Riyadh

the U.S. provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention.[388][389]Following the2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed onIran, he approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, twoPatriot batteries, and aTerminal High Altitude Area Defensesystem, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.[390]SyriaTrump and Turkish presidentRecep Tayyip ErdoÄŸanat the White House in May 2017Trump orderedmissile strikes in April 2017andApril 2018against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for theKhan ShaykhunandDouma chemical attacks, respectively.[391][392]In December 2018, he declared \"we have won against ISIS\", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria.[393][394]The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling Trump\\'s decision an abandonment of the U.S.\\'sKurdish allieswho played a key role in fighting ISIS.[395]In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish presidentRecep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan,U.S. troops in northern Syriawere withdrawn from the area and Turkeyinvaded northern Syria, attacking

U.S.from theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 agreement that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for restrictions onIran\\'s nuclear program.[399][400]In August 2020, his administration unsuccessfully attempted to use a section of the nuclear deal to have the UN reimpose sanctions against Iran.[401]Analysts determined that, after the U.S. withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.[402][403]On January\\xa01, 2020, Trump ordereda U.S. airstrikethat killed Iranian generalQasem Soleimani, who had planned nearly every significant Iranian andIranian-backedoperation over the preceding two decades.[404][405]One week later, Iran retaliated withballistic missile strikes against two U.S. airbasesin Iraq. Dozens of soldiers sustained traumatic brain injuries. He downplayed their injuries, and they were initially deniedPurple Heartmedals and the benefits accorded to their recipients.[406][402]PersonnelMain articles:Political appointments by Donald TrumpandFirst cabinet of Donald TrumpThe Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of his first year in office, 34\\xa0percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[407]As of early July\\xa02018[update], 61\\xa0percent of his senior aides had left[408]and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[409]Both figures set a record for recent presidentsâ€”more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[410]Notable early departures included National Security AdvisorMichael Flynn(after just 25 days), and Press SecretarySean Spicer.[410]Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon,Hope Hicks,John McEntee, andKeith Schillerquit or were forced out.[411]Some later returned in different posts.[412]He publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[413]Trump had fourWhite House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several.[414]Reince Priebuswas replaced after seven months by retired Marine generalJohn F. Kelly.[415]Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and Trump subsequently disparaged him.[416]Kelly was succeeded byMick Mulvaneyas acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 byMark Meadows.[414]On May\\xa09, 2017, Trumpdismissed FBI director James Comey. While initially attributing this action to Comey\\'s conduct in the investigation aboutHillary Clinton\\'s emails, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey\\'s role in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[417]At a private conversation in February, he said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn.[418]In March and April, he asked Comey to \"lift the cloud impairing his ability to act\" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.[418][419]Trump lost three of his 15 original cabinet members within his first year.[420]Health and Human Services secretaryTom Pricewas forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft.[420][411]Environmental Protection Agency administratorScott Pruittresigned in 2018 and Secretary of the InteriorRyan Zinkein January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.[421][422]Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[423]By January\\xa08, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61\\xa0percent) and he had no nominee for 264 (37\\xa0percent).[424]JudiciaryFurther information:List of federal judges appointed by Donald TrumpandDonald Trump judicial appointment controversiesTrump and his third Supreme Court nominee,Amy Coney BarrettTrump appointed 226Article III judges, including 54 to thecourts of appealsandthreeto theSupreme Court:Neil Gorsuch,Brett Kavanaugh, andAmy Coney Barrett.[425]His Supreme Court nominees were noted as having politically shifted the Court to the right.[426][427][428]In the 2016 campaign, he pledged thatRoe v. Wadewould be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and provided the opportunity to appoint two or three anti-abortion justices. He later took credit whenRoewas overturned inDobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.[429][430][431]Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary\\'s constitutional authority. His attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of his statements on thejudicial independenceand public confidence in the judiciary.[432][433][434]COVID-19 pandemicMain article:COVID-19 pandemic in the United StatesFurther information:U.S. federal government response to the COVID-19 pandemicandCommunication of the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemicSee also:Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United StatesInitial responseThe first confirmed case ofCOVID-19in the U.S. was reported on January\\xa020, 2020.[435]The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency byHealth and Human Services (HHS) SecretaryAlex Azaron January\\xa031, 2020.[436]Trump initially ignored persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.[437]Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak.[438]In February 2020 he publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly thaninfluenza, was \"very much under control\", and would soon be over.[439]On March\\xa019, he privately toldBob Woodwardthat he was deliberately \"playing it down, because I don\\'t want to create a panic\".[440]By mid-March, most global financial markets hadseverely contractedin response to the pandemic.[441]On March\\xa06, Trump signed theCoronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3\\xa0billion in emergency funding for federal agencies.[442]On March\\xa011, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) recognized COVID-19 as apandemic,[443]and he announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March\\xa013.[444]That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak \"horrible\" but \"a temporary moment\" and saying there was no financial crisis.[445]On March\\xa013, he declared anational emergency, freeing up federal resources.[446]He claimed that \"anybody that wants a test can get a test\", despite test availability being severely limited.[447]On March 27, he signed theCARES Actâ€”a $2.2 trillioneconomic stimulusbillâ€”into law following bipartisan negotiations in Congress, becoming the largest stimulus in U.S. history.[448][449]On April\\xa022, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration.[450]In late spring and early summer, with infections and deaths continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.[451]White House Coronavirus Task ForceTrump conducts a COVID-19 press briefing with members of theWhite House Coronavirus Task Forceon March\\xa015, 2020.Trump established theWhite House Coronavirus Task Forceon January\\xa029.[452]Beginning in mid-March, he held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,[453]sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.[454]He was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.[455][failed verification]On March\\xa016, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.[456]His repeated use of \"Chinese virus\" and \"China virus\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[457][458]By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration\\'s response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the WHO.[459]The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which he suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;[460]the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.[461][462]In early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, he said the task force would \"indefinitely\" continue.[463]By the end of May, the coronavirus task force\\'s meetings were sharply reduced.[464]World Health OrganizationPrior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the WHO and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[465]His administration\\'s proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[465]In May and April, he accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging\" COVID-19, alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government\\'s concealment of the pandemic\\'s origins,[465][466][467]and announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[465]These were seen as attempts to distract from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[465][468][469]In July 2020, he announced the formal withdrawal of the U.S. from the WHO, effective July 2021.[466][467]The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \"short-sighted\", \"senseless\", and \"dangerous\".[466][467]Pressure to abandon pandemic mitigation measuresFurther information:COVID-19 testing in the United StatesIn April 2020, Republican-connected groups organizedanti-lockdown protestsagainst the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[470][471]Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[472]although the targeted states did not meet his administration\\'s guidelines for reopening.[473]In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized,GeorgiaGovernorBrian Kemp\\'s plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.[474]Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions to reverse the damage to the country\\'s economy.[475]He often refused tomaskat public events, contrary to his administration\\'s April 2020 guidance to wear masks in public[476]and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing spread of the virus.[477]By June, he had said masks were a \"double-edged sword\"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.[477]His contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.[476][477]In June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \"makes us look bad\".[478][479]The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be \"quickly identified and tested\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.[480][481]In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.[482][483]The day after thispolitical interferencewas reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation.[483]Despite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99\\xa0percent of COVID-19 cases are \"totally harmless\".[484][485]He began insisting that all states should resume in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases.[486]Political pressure on health agenciesMain article:Political interference with science agencies by the first Trump administrationTrump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[482]such as approving unproven treatments[487][488]or speeding up vaccine approvals.[488]Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined his claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[489][490]Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \"deep state\" opposing him and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[491]Outbreak at the White HouseMain article:White House COVID-19 outbreakTrump boardsMarine Onefor COVID-19 treatment on October\\xa02, 2020On October\\xa02, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive forCOVID-19, part of a White House outbreak.[492]Later that dayhe was hospitalizedatWalter Reed National Military Medical Center, reportedly due to fever and labored breathing. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October\\xa05, still infectious and unwell.[493][494]During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus.[493]In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case.[494]In January 2021, he received a COVID-19 vaccination.[495]Effects on the 2020 presidential campaignBy July 2020, Trump\\'s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue in the presidential election.[496]Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue.[497]Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[496]and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with anIpsos/ABC Newspoll indicating 65\\xa0percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.[498]In the final months of the campaign, he repeatedly said that the U.S. was \"rounding the turn\" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing cases and deaths.[499]A few days before the November\\xa03 election, the U.S. reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[500]InvestigationsAfter he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, hisprivate businesses, personal taxes, andcharitable foundation.[501]There were ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[502]FinancialIn April 2019, theHouse Oversight Committeeissuedsubpoenasseeking financial details from Trump\\'s banks, Deutsche Bank andCapital One, and his accounting firm,Mazars USA. He sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chairElijah Cummingsto prevent the disclosures.[503]In May,DC District CourtjudgeAmit Mehtaruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[504]and judgeEdgardo Ramosof theSouthern District Court of New Yorkruled that the banks must also comply.[505][506]Trump\\'s attorneys appealed.[507]In September 2022, the committee and Trump agreed to a settlement about Mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents.[508]Russian election interferenceMain articles:Russian interference in the 2016 United States electionsandTimelines related to Donald Trump and Russian interference in United States electionsSee also:Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential electionandSteele dossierIn January 2017, American intelligence agenciesâ€”theCIA, theFBI, and theNSA, represented by theDirector of National Intelligenceâ€”jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[509][510]In March 2017, FBI DirectorJames Comeytold Congress, \"[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\\'s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\\'s efforts.\"[511]Many suspicious[512]links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spieswere discovered and the relationships between Russians and \"team Trump\", including Manafort, Flynn, and Stone, were widely reported by the press.[513][514][515][516]Members of Trump\\'s campaign and his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the election.[517][518]On December\\xa029, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian AmbassadorSergey Kislyakabout sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence.[519]Trump told Kislyak andSergei Lavrovin May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[520]Trump and his allies promoteda conspiracy theorythat Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 electionâ€”which was also promoted by Russia toframeUkraine.[521]FBI Crossfire Hurricane and 2017 counterintelligence investigationsIn July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamedCrossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.[522]After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump\\'s personal andbusiness dealings with Russia.[523]Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,[524]but Deputy Attorney GeneralRod Rosensteinended the investigation into Trump\\'s direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that theRobert Mueller\\'s special counsel investigation would pursue the matter.[525][526]Mueller investigationMain articles:Mueller special counsel investigation,Mueller report, andCriminal charges brought in the Mueller special counsel investigationIn May 2017, Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Muellerspecial counselfor theDepartment of Justice(DOJ), ordering him to \"examine \\'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government\\' and the Trump campaign\". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters \"in connection with Russia\\'s 2016 election interference\".[525]The special counsel also investigated whether Trump\\'sdismissal of James Comeyas FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[527]and the Trump campaign\\'s possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,Turkey,Qatar, Israel, and China.[528]Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times, but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[529]In March 2019, Mueller gavehis final reportto Attorney GeneralWilliam Barr,[530]which Barr purported to summarizein a letter to Congress. A federal court, and Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation\\'s conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public.[531][532][533]Trump repeatedly claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not.[534]A redacted version of the report, publicly released in April 2019, found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump.[535]Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the report found that the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[536][537]The report revealed sweeping Russian interference[537]and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing it would benefit them electorally.[538][539][540][541]The report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump, but \"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\\'s conduct\".[542][543]Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\" as anOffice of Legal Counselopinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted,[544]and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[545]The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".[544]The House of Representatives subsequently launched animpeachment inquiryfollowing theTrumpâ€“Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.[546][547]Several Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller\\'s investigation and related cases, including Manafort[548]and Flynn.[549][550]Trump\\'s former attorneyMichael Cohenpleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\\'s 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to builda Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump.[551]In February 2020, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering. The sentencing judge said Stone \"was prosecuted for covering up for the president\".[552]First impeachmentMain articles:First impeachment of Donald TrumpandTrumpâ€“Ukraine scandalMembers of House of Representatives vote on twoarticles of impeachment(H.Res.\\xa0755), December\\xa018, 2019In August 2019, awhistleblowerfiled a complaint with theInspector General of the Intelligence Communityabout a July\\xa025 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his sonHunter.[553]The whistleblower said that the White House had attempted to cover up the incident and that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Trump attorneyRudy Giulianithat may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence\\'s May 2019 Ukraine trip.[554]House SpeakerNancy Pelosiinitiateda formal impeachment inquiryon September\\xa024.[555]Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision.[556][557]On September\\xa025, his administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr.[553][558]The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump\\'s personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[559]In October,William B. Taylor Jr., thechargÃ© d\\'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment to investigate the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[560]He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.[561]On December\\xa013, theHouse Judiciary Committeevoted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: one forabuse of powerand one forobstruction of Congress.[562]After debate, the House of RepresentativesimpeachedTrump on both articles on December\\xa018.[563]Trump displaying the headline \"Trump acquitted\"During the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and asserted that Trump\\'s actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the impeachment process.[564]Trump\\'s lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges, but said that he had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[565]They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because he was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.[565]On January\\xa031, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents.[566]The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.[567]Trump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority. SenatorMitt Romneywas the only Republican who voted to convict him on one charge, the abuse of power.[568]Following his acquittal, he fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.[569]Second impeachmentMain articles:Second impeachment of Donald TrumpandSecond impeachment trial of Donald TrumpSpeaker of the HouseNancy Pelosisigning the second impeachment of TrumpOn January\\xa011, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump withincitement of insurrectionagainst the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[570]The House voted 232â€“197 to impeach him on January\\xa013, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.[571]Ten Republicans voted for the impeachmentâ€”the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[572]On February\\xa013, following afive-day Senate trial, Trump was acquitted when the Senate vote fell ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president.[573][574]Most Republicans voted to acquit him, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (he had left office on January\\xa020; the Senate voted 56â€“44 that the trial was constitutional).[575]2020 presidential electionDefeated by BidenMain articles:2020 United States presidential electionandDonald Trump 2020 presidential campaignBreaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[576]He held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office[577]and officially became theRepublican nomineein August 2020.[578]In his first two years in office, Trump\\'s reelection committee reported raising $67.5\\xa0million and began 2019 with $19.3\\xa0million in cash.[579]By July 2020, his campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1\\xa0billion and spent $800\\xa0million, losing their cash advantage over Biden.[580]The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.[581]Trump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won.[582]He repeatedly misrepresented Biden\\'s positions[583][584]and shifted to appeals to racism.[585]Starting in the spring of 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[586][587]When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25\\xa0billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, he blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail, creating acrisis in the Postal Service.[588]He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results if he lost and commit to apeaceful transition of power.[589][590]Biden won the election on November\\xa03, receiving 81.3\\xa0million votes (51.3\\xa0percent) to Trump\\'s 74.2\\xa0million (46.8\\xa0percent)[591][592]and 306Electoral Collegevotes to Trump\\'s 232.[593]Rejection of resultsFurther information:Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election,2020â€“21 United States election protests, andElection denial movement in the United StatesAt 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[594]After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump stated that \"this election is far from over\" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[595]He and his allies filed manylegal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both thestateandfederal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[596][597]His allegations were also refuted by state election officials.[598]AfterCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security AgencydirectorChris Krebscontradicted Trump\\'s fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November\\xa017.[599]On December\\xa011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to heara case from the Texas attorney generalthat asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[600]Trump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election.[601]He initially blocked government officials from cooperating inBiden\\'s presidential transition.[602][603]After three weeks, the administrator of theGeneral Services Administrationdeclared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[604]Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.[605][606]The Electoral College formalized Biden\\'s victory on December\\xa014.[593]From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help tooverturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders,[607]Republican state and federal legislators,[608]the Justice Department,[609]and Vice President Pence,[610]urging various actions such asreplacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result.[608]On February\\xa010, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump\\'s efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.[611]Trump did not attendBiden\\'s inauguration.[612]January 6 Capitol attackMain article:January 6 United States Capitol attackFor a chronological guide, seeTimeline of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.Trump speaking at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January\\xa06In December 2020,Newsweekreportedthe Pentagonwas on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what to do if Trump declaredmartial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role in the outcome of elections.[613]When Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of StaffMark Milleyand CIA directorGina Haspelbecame concerned about a possiblecoupattempt or military action against China or Iran.[614][615]Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons.[616][617]On January\\xa06, 2021, whilecongressional certification of the presidential election resultswas taking place in the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a noon rally atthe Ellipsein Washington, D.C., where he called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol.[618][619]Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. The mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[620]During the violence, Trump posted messages onTwitterwithout asking the rioters to disperse. At 6\\xa0p.m., he tweeted that the rioters should \"go home with love & in peace\", calling them \"great patriots\" and repeating that the election was stolen.[621]After the mob was removed, Congress reconvened and confirmed Biden\\'s win in the early hours of the following morning.[622]According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died.[623][624]In March 2023, Trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on asong to benefit the prisoners.

In May 2021, he and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself.[630][631]The Republican Party used his false election narrative to justify theimposition of new voting restrictionsin its favor.[631][632]As late as July 2022, he was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the 2020 election.[633]Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; he has been described as a modernparty boss. He continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on how elections are run and on ousting election officials who had resisted his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. In the2022 midterm electionshe endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices,most of whom supportedhis false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.[634][635][636]Business activitiesIn February 2021, Trump registered a new company,Trump Media & Technology Group(TMTG), for providing \"social networking services\" to U.S. customers.[637][638]In March 2024, TMTG merged withspecial-purpose acquisition companyDigital World Acquisitionand became apublic company.[639]In February 2022, TMTG launchedTruth Social, a social media platform.[640]As of March\\xa02023[update], Trump Media, which had taken $8\\xa0million from Russia-connected entities, was being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible money laundering.[641][642]Investigations, criminal indictments and convictions, civil lawsuitsTrump isthe only U.S. president or former presidentto be convicted of a crime and the first major-party candidate to run for president after a felony conviction.[643]As of May 2024, he faces numerous criminal charges and civil cases.[644][645]FBI investigationsMain articles:FBI investigation into Donald Trump\\'s handling of government documents,FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, andSmith special counsel investigationClassified intelligence material found during search of Mar-a-LagoWhen Trump left the White House in January 2021, he took government materials with him to Mar-a-Lago. By May 2021, theNational Archives and Records Administration(NARA) realized that important documents had not been turned over to them and asked his office to locate them. In January 2022, they retrieved 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago.

He tweeted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until Twitter banned him after the January\\xa06 attack.[812]He often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press.[813]In June 2017, the White House press secretary said that his tweets were official presidential statements.[814]After years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checks in May 2020.[815]In response, he tweeted that social media platforms \"totally silence\" conservatives and that he would \"strongly regulate, or close them down\".[816]In the days after the storming of the Capitol, he was banned fromFacebook,Instagram, Twitter and other platforms.[817]The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events[818][819]and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter.[820]In February 2022, he launched social media platformTruth Socialwhere he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[821]Elon Musk, afteracquiring Twitter, reinstated his Twitter account in November 2022.[822][823]Meta Platforms\\' two-year ban lapsed in January 2023, allowing him to return to Facebook and Instagram,[824]although in 2024, he continued to call the company an \"enemy of the people\".[825]Relationship with the pressFurther information:First presidency of Donald Trump Â§\\xa0Relationship with the news mediaTrump talking to the press, March 2017Trump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love-hate\" relationship with the press.[826]In the 2016 campaign, he benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[164]The New York TimeswriterAmy Chozickwrote in 2018 that his media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV\".[827]As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"theenemy of the people\".[828]In 2018, journalistLesley Stahlsaid that he had privately told her that he intentionally discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[829]As president, Trump mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical.[830]His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[831]The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.[831]Trump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press.[832]The Trump campaign suedThe New York Times,The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference. All the suits were dismissed.[833]By 2024, he repeatedly voiced support for outlawing political dissent and criticism he considers misleading or challenges his claims to power,[834]and that media companies should be investigated and prosecuted for treason for displaying \"bad stories\" about him and possibly lose their broadcast licenses if they refuse to name confidential sources.[835]Notes^Presidential elections in the U.S. are decided by theElectoral College.

Due to the sheer volume of books about Trump, the titles listed here are limited to non-fiction books about Trump or his presidency, published bynotableauthors and scholars. Tertiary sources (including textbooks and juvenile literature), satire, and self-published books are excluded.Prior to his2016 campaign, Trump was already the focus of many books describing his life as a businessman and politician.[1]BiographerMichael D\\'Antonioobserved inNever Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success(2015) that Trump \"has been a topic of conversation in America for almost 40 years. No one in the world of business\\xa0– not Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Warren Buffett\\xa0– has been as famous as Trump for as long.\" Almost one year after his inauguration as president,The Guardiannoted that more than 4,500 English-language books about Trump had been published since he took office, compared to just over 800 works about Trump\\'s predecessorBarack Obamaduring his first year in office.[2]This \"Trump bump\" for the U.S. publishing industry, asThe New York Timesput it, persisted throughout his time in office.[3]But afterwards, demand for books about his presidency dropped off sharply.[4]Trump\\'s first published book in 1987 wasTrump: The Art of the Deal, written byghostwriterTony Schwartz.[1][5][6]Trump made a practice of hiring ghostwriters and co-authors to write his books.[7][8][9]In some cases the ghostwriters are credited on the cover, while in other instances, includingTime to Get Tough(2011) andCrippled America(2015), Trump makes mention of the writer\\'s contributions in the acknowledgements sections. Works written by Trump himself includeself-help books,personal financebooks, political policy treatises, andautobiographies.[1][10]\"...Schwartz has noted that, during the year and a half that they worked together onThe Art of the Deal, he never saw a single book in Trump\\'s office or apartment. Yet Trump has taken authorial credits on more than a dozen books to date, and, given that he\\'s a proven marketing master, it\\'s inconceivable that he won\\'t try to sell more.\"[11]The Washington PostjournalistCarlos Lozadaobserved that a continuous theme throughout Trump\\'s written works is a focus on Trump himself, such as citing examples from his business inreal estate investingand work on television. Parties and individuals discussed in books by Trump are reduced to azero-sum game, according to Lozada: \"Trump\\'s world isbinary, divided into class acts and total losers.\" Trump often makes use ofhyperboleto illustrate his points in his works. In other books, Trump repeats the same stories of what he views as key successes from his business career; for example, a tale about a 1980s business deal improving theWollman RinkinCentral Park, New York.[10]Trump\\'s published writings shifted post-2000, from generally memoirs about himself to books giving advice about finance.[10]Credited to Trump[edit]Further information:Media career of Donald TrumpTitleYearPublisherISBN / OCLCGhostwriter(s)NotesTrump: The Art of the Deal1987Random House978-0-345-47917-4Tony Schwartz[5][6]It reached number 1 onThe New York TimesBest Seller list, stayed there for 13 weeks, and altogether held a position on the list for 48 weeks.Schwartz discussed his alleged ghostwriting, in a 2016 article inThe New Yorker.[12]Trump: Surviving at the Top1990Random House978-0-394-57597-1Charles Leerhsen[13]Subsequently, as:The Art of Survival(1991),ISBN978-0-446-36209-2Trump: The Art of the Comeback1997Times Books978-0-8129-2964-5Kate Bohner[14]The America We Deserve2000Renaissance Books978-1-580-63131-0Dave Shiflett[15]Published during decision-making process for theDonald Trump presidential campaign, 2000.[16]Trump: How to Get Rich2004Random House978-0-345-48103-0Meredith McIver[17][18]The Way to the Top: The Best Business Advice I Ever Received2004Crown Business978-1-4000-5016-1Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life2004Random House978-0-345-48140-5Meredith McIver[18]The Best Golf Advice I Ever Received2005Crown978-0-307-20999-3Why We Want You to Be Rich2006Rich Press978-1-933914-02-2Meredith McIver[18]Robert Kiyosakias coauthor.

She is the firstnaturalized citizento become first lady, the second foreign-born first lady afterLouisa Adams, and the second Catholic first lady afterJacqueline Kennedy. As her husband was re-elected in the2024 presidential election, Trump is set to return to her role as first lady on January 20, 2025, following her husband\\'ssecond inauguration. She will become the second first lady in history to serve two non-consecutive terms.[c]Melanija Knavs was born in Slovenia—then part ofYugoslavia—where she began working as a fashion model at the age of 16. She changed the spelling of her name toMelania Knauss, and she traveled toParisandMilanto seek modeling work before meetingPaolo Zampolli, who hired her and sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1996. She continued working as a model in Manhattan, where Zampolli introduced her to thereal estate developerDonald Trump in 1998. Melania and Donald began dating shortly afterward. He worked to get her more modeling jobs, and she supported him during his2000 presidential campaign. Melania and Donald Trump married in 2005, and they had a son,Barron Trump, the following year. She dedicated most of her time to Barron during his infancy, spending less time working or accompanying her husband at events. She started her own jewelry brand, Melania, in 2009.After encouraging Donald torun for presidentin the2016 presidential election, Melania only made rare campaign appearances, opting to help Donald strategize over the phone. She received major press coverage during the campaign when erotic photos from her modeling years were uncovered and published, and again when a speech she gave at the2016 Republican National Conventionwas found to be plagiarized from a similar speech byMichelle Obama. In the month leading up to the election, she defended her husband following the release of theAccess Hollywoodtapethat had caused a scandal for her husband.Melania stayed in Manhattan for the first months of her tenure as first lady, allowing Barron to finish school and Melania to renegotiate herprenuptial agreement. Her stepdaughterIvanka Trumpfulfilled some of the first lady\\'s traditional duties. She kept to minimal activity after moving into theWhite House, often staying in the residence instead of her office in theEast Wing, and she held fewer events than previous first ladies. Melania faced several challenges in 2018, includingallegations of extramarital affairsby her husband, surgery forkidney disease, and a tour of Africa that was overshadowed by scandals. During her tenure as first lady, Melania prioritized children\\'s issues, launching theBe Bestcampaign to promote children\\'s welfare and making many visits to children\\'s hospitals. She opposed her husband\\'sfamily separation policyand convinced him to end the practice. She was a close advisor to her husband. In the final months of her tenure, Melania endorsed her husband\\'sfalse claims of election fraudin the2020 presidential election, and has largely stayed out of public view since leaving the White House.Early life and educationMelanija Knavs was born inNovo Mesto, Yugoslavia, now part of present-daySlovenia, on April 26, 1970.[4][5]Her father Viktor Knavs first worked as a chauffeur, and he eventually sold car parts for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer as he made connections with theLeague of Communists of Yugoslavia, the national communist party.[6]Her motherAmalijaworked as apatternmakerat the children\\'s clothing manufacturer Jutranjka inSevnica.[4][7]In Sevnica, the family lived in the state-run housing complex Naselje Heroja Maroka.[8]She has an older sister, Ines,[9]and an older half-brother from her father\\'s previous relationship, Denis Cigelnjak, whom she reportedly has never met.[10]Her father denied paternity of the boy, even after it was confirmed by apaternity test.[11]Although Melanija\\'s father was a member of Yugoslavia\\'s communist party, which espoused a policy ofstate atheism,[12]he had his daughters secretlybaptizedasCatholic, as was common.[13][14]The family was well-off relative to most who lived in communist societies. They frequently went on vacations to other parts of Europe.[11]Their apartment was decorated with brightly colored walls, which was a major departure from other apartments in the country.[11][10]As a child, Melanija, like other children of workers at the factory participated in fashion shows that featured children\\'s clothing.[15][7][16]Textiles were Sevnica\\'s primary industry. Students were excused from school to participate in the shows.[17]From a young age, Melanija expressed an interest in fashion, and she began customizing and sewing her own clothes.[8]She developed a skill for it by watching her mother work.[18]Melanija did well in school, where she was appointed school treasurer.[19]When Melanija was a teenager, she moved to a two-story house in Sevnica with her family.[20]From her youth in Slovenia, Melanija was influenced by the United States: she described thepresidency of Ronald Reaganas the beginning of a new era in her own country and the debut ofCNN Internationalin 1985 gave her family access to American media.[21]Of particular interest to Melanija was the new exposure to global fashion.[18]At the age of fifteen, she began attending the Secondary School for Design and Photography inLjubljana, making the long commute from her hometown to the capital and back each day by train. After her first year, she and Ines moved to the capital together in an apartment paid for by their father.[22]After graduating at age nineteen, Melanija enrolled in the Faculty of Architecture and Civil and Geodetic Engineering at theUniversity of Ljubljanato further study design, leaving after a few months without finishing her degree.[23][24]Early modeling careerEuropean careerMelania was discovered by Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko when she was sixteen, after modeling in a school-sponsored show.[25][26]At the time, she had wanted to be a fashion designer rather than a model.[11]Melania won a modeling contest with the Italian studioCinecittàthat entitled her to a movie role, but she rejected the prize after a producer sexually propositioned her.[27]As her modeling career progressed, Melania took on an alternate spelling of her name, Melania Knauss. She traveled Europe to find modeling work.[23][28]Except a few close relatives, she did not maintain contact with anyone she knew in Slovenia.[29]In 1992, Melania was namedrunner-upin theJana MagazineLook of the Yearcontest, which promised its top three contestants an international modeling contract.[4][23][11]She signed with RVR Reclame in Milan, but she left the organization a few months later.[30]Melania spent the following years traveling Europe for modeling jobs, including one in which she portrayed the first female president of the United States in 1993.[31]Around age 23 or 24, she made Paris her primary residence, where she lived with her roommateVictoria Silvstedt.[32]Melania modeled for fashion houses in Paris and Milan, where in 1995 she met Metropolitan Models co-ownerPaolo Zampolli, who was on a scouting trip in Europe. Zampolli, a friend of her future husbandDonald Trump,[16]became one of the few people who was involved in Melania\\'s life for a long time.[33]Relocating to New YorkZampolli urged Melania to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her.[16]In 1996, Melania moved to Manhattan.[16][11]By this time, she was already 26 years old, much older than most aspiring models.[34]Zampolli encouraged Melania to live near and socialize with people in the fashion industry,[35]and he arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian inZeckendorf TowersinUnion Square.[36][16]Her rent was taken from her pay with Zampolli\\'s agency.[37]Once she resided in the United States, she returned to her home country only sparingly and only for short periods of time.[38]She lived a healthy lifestyle, managing her diet carefully,[39]and she avoided the drinking and partying that often consumed the lives of the models around her.[40]She did not lead an active social life and only went out on rare occasions.[40][39]Melania was featured in a sexually explicit photo shoot for a 1997 issue ofMax, a French men\\'s magazine, with another female model. The photos were shot by the photographer Alexandre Ale de Basseville, and the work was unpaid, instead promising Melania exposure in a prominent magazine. The photos were largely forgotten until they were published by theNew York Postin 2016.[41]For her first weeks in the United States, hertravel visadid not allow her to work in the country. Despite this, she accepted ten modeling jobs that earned her approximately $20,000 (equivalent to $39,000 in 2023). She then received anH-1B visathat allowed her to work.[35]She received her first major job when she posed for aCamel cigarettead shot byEllen von Unwerth, which was displayed as aTimes Squarebillboard and ran inRolling Stone. The opportunity came about from a law that required cigarette ads only feature individuals above the age of 25, which excluded most aspiring models.[42]When her roommate Atanian left New York, Melania moved to an apartment off ofPark Avenue.[43]Marriage and familyMeeting Donald TrumpDonald Trump and Melania Knauss in 1999In September 1998, Zampolli introduced Melania to the real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party.[44]Donald had a date to the event,Celina Midelfart. When he asked Melania for her phone number, she refused. Instead, she insisted that he give her his own number. He passed her test when he gave her multiple personal numbers instead of an office number.[45][46]She later said that giving her own number would make her \"just one of the women he calls\".[45]The exact details of when and where this took place are unclear, though the Kit Kat Club is often described as where they met.[47]After a week, Melania called Donald and they went on a date.[48]She intentionally gave him an indifferent attitude to his advances, knowing this would pique his interest.[49]Not only was Donald\\'s personality similar to that of Melania\\'s father,[15][50][51]but they were of similar ages and had similar physical appearances.[11][50][52]When they began dating, Melania had access to his bookTrump: The Art of the Comeback, in which he detailed what he wanted from a relationship.[53][54]Melania held a press conference on September 8, spending the event recounting her successes and telling reporters that she was \"world famous\", \"among the top 50\" highest paid models in the world, and set to appear in a movie alongsideMickey Rourke.[55]The intention was to build her profile in anticipation of another, ultimately unsuccessful, cigarette ad campaign.[56]This was unusual behavior for a woman who typically kept a quiet and professional presence,[57]and reporters were unable to verify the claims she made.[58]The Trumps have stated that they met at theNew York Fashion Weekshortly after this conference, but according to biographerMary Jordan, rumors in the industry suggested that their relationship had already developed by then.[57]Their relationship initially only lasted a few weeks. Melania left Donald after she saw his ex-girlfriendKara YoungleavingTrump Tower, but she reunited with him the following week.[59]Relationship with Donald TrumpDonald\\'s fame and connections gave her new career opportunities.[60]Shortly after the death ofJacqueline Kennedy, whom Melania and her mother had deeply admired, Melania met theKennedy familyat a gala.[61]She continued to encounter celebrities while attending events with Donald.[62]Melania continued her modeling career after meeting Donald,[16]though she took fewer jobs as time went on and she dedicated more time to him.[63]In 1999, the couple gained attention after an interview withshock jockHoward Sternon his show, in which he asked them lewd sexual questions.[64]Donald often brought Melania to meetings to show her off, praising her beauty. He did not let her participate in the business, citing the conflict he had with his first wife after giving her an executive role.[65]Melania Knauss withKylie Bax, Donald Trump, and then-presidentBill Clintonin 2000Donald announcedhis candidacyfor theReform Party presidential nominationon October 7, 1999. Melania adamantly supported the move.[66]When asked byThe New York Timeswhat her role would be if Donald were to become president, Melania replied: \"I would be very traditional, likeBetty Fordor Jackie Kennedy.\"[67]Melania saw extensive media attention astabloidsconsidered the idea of a model as first lady.[68]Melania was one of the first models recruited to Donald\\'s modeling agency,Trump Model Management, after its creation in February 1999. The following months, she appeared in several magazines and advertisements organized by individuals close to Donald.[69]While Donald was organizing his campaign, Melania appeared in the February edition ofSports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. The image featured her in a bikini alongside a large inflatable whale, and the shoot was run byAntoine Verglas, an associate of Zampolli\\'s.[70]Shortly after the shoot, Verglas called Melania back for another project where he had her pose nude in aBond girlaesthetic.[71]Melania later said that she stood \\'proudly behind [her] nude modeling work\\' in a post on X in September of 2024.[72]Donald had lobbied for her inclusion in aGQspread,[73]and her relationship with Donald allowed the shoot access to hisBoeing 727. Images from the shoot were featured in the January 2000 edition ofGQmagazine.[71]At the time, Donald\\'s involvement was not made known.[35]She then appeared in another sexualized photo shoot where she was posted in a mock-up of theOval Office.[74]In January 2000, news broke that Melania and Donald had broken up, with conflicting accounts of who ended the relationship. Many photos and publicity pieces the two had done together were quickly edited before publication to accommodate the change.[75]They kept in contact, and they reunited a few months later.[76]Melania received hergreen cardin 2001, granting herpermanent residencyin the United States.[35][4]Melania and Donald moved in together at Trump Tower in 2002.[77]She made her first appearance on Donald\\'s game showThe Apprenticein April 2004 when an episode had the contestants visit their penthouse.[78]Engagement and weddingDonald proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, on her birthday as they were leaving to attend theMet Gala.[79]He reasoned that he was more willing to wed as she had not insisted on marriage, and he felt she was an influence in the success he had seen over the previous years.[80]She also signed hisprenuptial agreementwithout issue.[81]A few months before the wedding, Melania traveled to Paris withAnna WintourandAndré Leon Talleyto find a wedding dress, and Melania decided on a dress byJohn Galliano.[82]In the days leading up to the wedding, she appeared on the front cover ofVoguein her dress.[83][84]Donald and Melania married on January 22, 2005, at theBethesda-by-the-Seachurch inPalm Beach, Florida.[85]The ceremony was followed by a reception in theballroomat Donald\\'sMar-a-Lagoestate, which Melania planned with Preston Bailey.[86]Numerous celebrities were present, including musicians, athletes, media executives, and television personalities.[87]She had onebridesmaid, her sister Ines, who had moved to New York so they could be closer together.[38]Melania arranged all of the details of the wedding with her planner. She let Donald make decisions about the event, but she refused his suggestion that the wedding be broadcast onNBC.[88]Marriage and motherhoodDonald Trump and Melania Trump in 2006The Trumps hadthree residencesthat they traveled between: Trump Tower in New York,Trump National Golf Club Bedminsterin New Jersey, and Mar-a-Lago in Florida.[38][89]To have her own private abode, Melania had a private spa constructed on the top floor of Trump Tower.[89]As a couple, the two did not spend much direct time together, preferring to live adjacently with one another.[90]According to Donald, their passive relationship suited him because he worked for a living and did not \"want to go home and work at a relationship\".[11][91]Melania accepted a transaction element in their relationship, though she cared about Donald and did not believe that she was agold digger.[92]When she attended events with her husband at Trump facilities, she often stayed for only a few minutes to make an appearance before returning to the private residence.[93]Donald did not learn to speak Melania\\'s native language, which she said she accepted because she is \"not a nagging wife\".[4]Upon marrying Donald, Melania became stepmother to his four children:Donald Trump Jr.,Eric TrumpandIvanka Trumpfrom his first marriage toIvana Zelníčková, andTiffany Trumpfrom his second marriage toMarla Maples.[94]Melania had especially bonded with Tiffany, who was six when Melania began dating Tiffany\\'s father, and made sure she felt included among her step-siblings.[95]When Melania herself became pregnant, it was widely covered in the media.[96]This included her second appearance on the cover ofVogue, featuring her pregnant body in a bikini and an open coat.[97]Melania spent the months with her sister and her parents, who visited throughout the pregnancy. She also oversaw the construction of a nursery in Trump Tower.[98]She had ababy showerat theFAO Schwarztoy store, but she insisted that the toys and gifts she received be donated to a children\\'s hospital.[99]On March 20, 2006, Melania and Donald had a son,Barron William Trump.[100]Melania chose her son\\'s middle name, while Donald chose his first name.[101]Donald had previously used the name Barron as apseudonymfor when he posed as his own public relations agent.[102]After Barron was born, Melania was active in his life and accordingly spent less time attending events with her husband.[103][104]Donald had made it clear to her that if they had a child, he would not be actively involved in the child\\'s life.[104]Melania later said she approved of this, stating that she \"didn\\'t want him changing diapers or putting Barron to bed\".[11]She avoided the use of nannies, with a few exceptions in Barron\\'s earliest years, insisting on raising him herself.[105]This lessened social activity meant that Donald began courting supermodels again, which made Melania uncomfortable. According to biographer Mary Jordan, Melania did not know about the women who later alleged that they had extramarital affairs with him.[89]Melania stayed out of the public spotlight after she settled into her life as a Trump, excepting occasional charity work and an appearance in anAflaccommercial.[106]She became a citizen of the United States on July 28, 2006.[107]She then sponsored her parents using the \"chain migration\" immigration process that her husband later repeatedly criticized.[108][109]Melania and Barron maintaindual citizenship, both in the United States and Slovenia[110]Spending most of her time at Trump residences, she rarely kept companions besides her parents and her son.[93]Business venturesAs her son reached childhood, Melania found herself with more time for other pursuits.[111]She trademarked her name, Melania, in 2009 as a jewelry brand, which she used to sell less expensive jewelry pieces onQVC.[112]She was intentional about not using the Trump name in her branding, correcting reporters who called it Melania Trump.[113]She drew the designs herself,[11]which were based on three places where she had lived: New York, Palm Beach, and Paris. Over the following years, she released additionalMelaniacollections, and they sold out each time.[113]Melania Trump in 2011Melania then developed a line ofcaviar-infused skincare products under the brand Melania Marks Skincare in 2011.[114]The brand never launched. It brought about a legal case when the company selling the products, New Sunshine, underwent management changes and voided the contract. The company alleged that one executive had given asweetheart dealto the Trumps because he was a family friend. The case was decided in Melania\\'s favor, and the amount to be paid to her was settled out of court.[115]She had initially sued the company for $50 million in lost revenue.[116]Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaignPersonal life during the campaignMelania was the one who finally convinced Donaldto campaign for presidentin the2016 presidential election, telling him that he either needed to do it or stop talking about it.[117][118]When the campaign began, Melania made it clear to her husband that she would not be pressured into campaigning or attending events, and that she would only make appearances when she wanted to. She subsequently played a relatively small role in the campaign, which had been atypical of spouses of presidential candidates since the early 20th century.[119]Explaining her absence, she cited the need to stay home with her son Barron.[120][121]Her daily routine was nonetheless altered by the campaign, as she had to take security arrangements into account when she traveled, and she could not post about her activities online in real time.[122]Once a prolific user ofInstagramandTwitter, she became less active on her social media accounts when the campaign began.[11]While many people doubted Donald\\'s chances at the presidency, including his own inner circle, Melania believed he would win.[123][124]Unlike Donald\\'s advisors, Melania encouraged him to follow his instincts and say what he felt he should say, with the exception that she does not like his use of profane language.[125]She analyzed the campaign closely from home, following polling and watching how her husband interacted with his opponents.[126]She spoke to him on the phone regularly throughout the campaign, including a conversation after each rally in which she gave a candid evaluation of how he did.[127]Campaign involvementMelania Trump at a campaign event with Donald and Barron in November 2015Melania\\'s career as a model was an advantage during the campaign, as she was prepared for photographers and did not need to hire a fashion consultant.[23]As a model, she was required to be deliberate in all of her movement, including how she stood and walked.[128]She resented being called shy during the campaign, saying that this was an impression spread by people who only briefly met her and wanted their \"15 minutes of fame\".[129]Melania\\'s earliest speaking appearances in November 2015 and February 2016 were prompted by Donald calling on her to speak to the crowd. Both times, she only said a few sentences.[130]Her first scheduled speech during the campaign did not take place until April 2016.[121]The campaign reportedly wanted to get Melania more active, as she was in a unique position to humanize Donald and to appeal to theAmerican Dreamfrom an immigrant\\'s perspective.[131]Hope Hickswas the campaign\\'s main liaison with Melania, facilitating any appearances that she wished to make. Melania trusted Hicks\\'s judgement and allowed her to weigh the importance of a given appearance.[132]Her rare appearances brought her toswing stateswhere her husband needed extra support, and her speeches celebrated his personal traits instead of policy.[120]Melania was involved in thevice presidential selection process, meeting with the top contenders, and her approval ofMike Pencecontributed to his selection. The deciding factor, in her mind, was that Pence was not as ambitious as the other contenders and would not seek to undermine Donald.[133]Media coverageMelania Trump in 2016Anattack adagainst the Trumps was produced by asuper PACthat supported Donald\\'s opponentTed Cruzfeaturing Melania\\'s nudeGQphoto with the caption \"Meet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday\", intensifying the rivalry between the two candidates in the2016 Republican Party presidential primaries.[120][134][11]More nude images of Melania were published on the front page of theNew York Postin July 2016 in a story titled \"The Ogle Office\". The images did not have a major effect on the campaign, as Melania was seen as the victim, but they were humiliating and she spent the following two months away from the public.[135]On July 18, 2016, Melania gavea speechat the2016 Republican National Convention. A controversy emerged after it became apparent that a paragraph of the speech had been plagiarized fromMichelle Obama\\'s speech at the2008 Democratic National Convention.[136][137]When asked about it, Melania said she wrote the speech herself \"with as little help as possible\".[138]Despite political campaigns typically having several people to scrutinize such speeches, no one in the Trump campaign had reviewed the speech.[139]Donald was furious with his staff and felt he had failed Melania, while Melania felt she herself had failed the campaign through the scandal.[140]It was the only major speech she delivered during the campaign.[141]Two days later, Trump staff writerMeredith McIvertook responsibility, saying there was a misunderstanding when Melania read passages of Obama\\'s speech as examples.[136][142]The speech also included a rare statement on her past, describing her family in Slovenia and her early modeling career.[139]After giving the speech, Melania stayed out of public view until election day approached.[143]Access HollywoodtapeOn October 7, a month before the election, theAccess Hollywoodtapewas leaked. The tape had been recorded in 2005, shortly after their marriage, and it featured audio of Donald making controversial remarks about his treatment of women. Immediately after its release, the campaign\\'s primary concern was Melania\\'s reaction. It took Donald two hours before he went to see Melania. Upon their meeting, Melania reportedly told him \"Now you could lose, you could have blown this for us\", and then left the room after he apologized.[144]In 2024, her husband\\'s former personal counselMichael Cohentestified duringThe People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trumptrial that Donald had privately credited her as having suggested that the campaign\\'s response strategy should best characterize the conversation on the tape as\"locker room talk\".[145]Melania kept her distance from him, angry that he may have ended his candidacy with his comments, and she waited a day before making a comment.[146]When asked by the campaign to make a scripted appearance alongside Donald as damage control, she refused, deciding that she was going to respond her own way.[147]She also refused to sit beside him during his recorded apology as politicians\\' spouses often did in these situations.[148]Melania released a statement saying that the tape did not show \"the man I know\" and said those whoaccused him of sexual misconductare liars.[136]Melania received significantly more attention from the press following the incident,[149]and she was frustrated by the pity she received.[147]A few days later, she attended apresidential debatewearing apussy bow, causing widespread speculation about her intention (as her husband\\'s comments on the Access Hollywood tape had included, \"grab them by thepussy\"–with pussy beingslangforvagina).[150][149]After she voted, Melania spent most of election day with her parents in Trump Tower while the rest of the family did last minute campaigning.[151]First lady of the United States (2017–2021)First lady in ManhattanMelania Trump with Donald Trump at the Liberty Ball, January 20, 2017AfterDonald\\'s inaugurationas president on January 20, 2017,[152]Melania announced that she would not move toWashington, D.C.with him, instead staying in Manhattan so Barron could finish the school year there.[153]This also allowed her to introduce her son to theWhite Housegradually so as not to overwhelm him.[154]During this time, Melania negotiated new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald to reflect the changes in their lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron received a suitable inheritance.[155]Melania was the second foreign-born woman to hold the title of first lady afterLouisa Adams, who was born in England,[152]and Melania was the firstnaturalized citizento hold the title.[156]She has said that she can speak English, Italian, French, and German in addition to her native Slovene, but in public she has only spoken English and Slovene.[157]She was also the secondCatholicfirst lady of the United States, after Jacqueline Kennedy.[158][159]Melania\\'s absence from the White House caused speculation that her stepdaughter Ivanka would serve as an acting first lady.[153][160][161]As time went by, members of the administration\\'s staff like her assistant,Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, grew unhappy with Melania\\'s absence, as it gave the impression of marital issues and prevented her from exercising a calming influence over the president.[162][163]She also stoked resentment among many of the people in New York, who predominantly opposed the Trumps, because of the costs and traffic issues caused by theSecret Servicepresence.[164][165]The Secret Service itself also faced logistical issues from the repeated travel to New York. Having a Secret Service detail was not a major adjustment for Melania though, as she had spent years around her husband\\'s security team.[166]She was given theSecret Service code name\"Muse\" to go along with the president\\'s name \"Mogul\".[167]Being first lady came with another drawback for Melania, as she was expected to speak on serious topics such as immigration policy and had little control over how her media appearances were handled, which was a different experience than she had as a model.[168]Melania Trump with Pope Francis, the Vatican, May 2017When the Trump administration\\'sWhite House websitewas posted, Melania\\'s biographical information caused controversy because it listed her jewelry business. Though it had already ceased operation, critics alleged that it was an attempt to promote her business with government resources.[169]Another allegation of attempting to profit from her role as first lady came up in February, when she sued theDaily Mailfor libel after it alleged in 2016 that she had worked for anescort agency.[170]The suit was initially for lost career opportunities, but this was changed to emotional distress when she received questions about why she expected to have career opportunities as first lady.[171]On March 8, 2017, Melania hosted her first White House event, a luncheon forInternational Women\\'s Day. She spoke to an audience of women about her life as a female immigrant and about working towardsgender equalityboth domestically and abroad, noting the role of education as a tool againstgender inequality.[172][173]The Trumps visitedVatican Cityin May 2017. As Melania was visiting as a Catholic,Pope Francisblessed her rosary beads, and she placed flowers at the feet of a statue of theMadonnaat the Vatican\\'sBambino Gesùchildren\\'s hospital.[174]The first major public attention Melania received was after an incident in May 2017 while the Trumps were visiting Israel. Donald had forgotten that Melania was by his side when he was walking with Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu, and she fell behind from the group. Humiliated, she slapped away his hand when he reached out behind him to grab hers. This was the first time press coverage of Melania took notice of an independent streak.[175][176]East Wing staffThe lack of staff appointments in theEast Wingduring the first months of the Trump administration—typically the domain of the first lady—caused a backlog of tour requests to develop. In February several hires were made for theOffice of the First Lady:Anna Cristina Niceta Lloydas social secretary,Lindsay Reynoldsas the first lady\\'s chief of staff, Tham Kannalikham as her decorator, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff as the first lady\\'s assistant, andStephanie Grishamas communications director.[177]Melania retained the head florist appointed by Michelle Obama, Hedieh Ghaffarian.[178]Thechief usherappointed under theObama administration,Angella Reid, was replaced byTrump International HotelemployeeTimothy Harleth, breaking the norm of the chief usher serving under multiple presidencies.[177]Reid had been broadly unpopular with the staff, and the firing earned Melania their goodwill.[179]The first lady\\'s staff remained small relative to those of her predecessors.[177]This was in part because she did not want to have any employees speaking on her behalf. Instead, she answered her correspondences herself.[180]Melania had a reputation in the White House for being \"drama-free\",[181]and for treating the staff well.[182]According to her husband\\'s campaign managerCorey Lewandowski, her staff had \"100 percent loyalty to her\".[183]Melania had a close, trusting relationship with her staff, and she was protective of them when conflict arose.[184]Before moving in, Melania worked with Kannalikham to redecorate the White House, as first ladies typically do. She had most of the Obama-era decor replaced, and like the Obamas, the Trumps paid for it out of pocket instead of using the allotted funding.[185]Life in the White HouseMelania Trump with Argentine first ladyJuliana Awadain 2017Melania and her son, Barron, moved into the White House on June 11, 2017.[186]Like they had throughout their marriage, Melania and Donald chose to sleep in separate bedrooms.[187]In her first year, Melania gave only eight speeches, compared to 74 by Michelle Obama and 42 byLaura Bush.[188]Instead of frequent public appearances, she communicated her activities through video.[183]Most of Melania\\'s appearances as first lady in 2017 were in Manhattan and Washington, and she typically spoke about women\\'s and children\\'s issues.[189]After moving to the White House, Melania opted to spend most of her time in the private quarters, running the White House staff from there instead of the first lady\\'s East Wing offices. She oversaw restorations of several rooms in the building, including the bowling alley in theWhite House basementand the first lady\\'s hairdresser\\'s room.[190]She kept one office, called the \"swag room\" by aides, in which she kept trinkets she collected while she was first lady.[191]To accommodate Barron\\'s soccer practice, she had a net installed on the White House grounds and had a coach practice with him.[192]Barron remained Melania\\'s top priority when she was first lady, and she worked to keep him free from politics to the point that staffers referred to her as \"The Protector\".[193]Even after arriving at the White House, Melania spent extensive time away each year, visiting Mar-a-Lago on major holidays and over many weekends.[194]Melania Trump examining the 2018 White House Christmas decorationsMelania personally involved herself in decorations and planning within the White House.[195]She was particular about how things were designed and arranged whenever events were planned, but she would take on a calm and relaxed demeanor once the event began.[196]Whenever a foreign dignitary arrived at the White House, Melania had theBlue Roomset aside where she ate lunch or drank tea with the dignitary\\'s spouse.[197]When choosing whichpresidential china setto use, Melania often chose theClinton administrationchina with its gold embroidery.[198]She held events less frequently than her predecessors, with a typical week featuring three or fewer events, all under one hour long.[199]Among her most ambitious projects was planning the White House Christmas decorations in 2018. Moving away from traditional designs, she filled the East Collonnade with red cranberry-laden trees set atop a green carpet. The design was widely derided, which Melania ascribed to personal taste.[200]To protect use of her image and maintain an income, Melania licensed photos from her photoshoots throughGetty Images. This allowed her to choose how they were used by reporters, and she received royalties for each use. TheOffice of Government Ethicsreported that she made $100,000 to $1,000,000 in royalties in 2017, though other estimates put it at over $10,000,000.[201]As one of her official duties, Melania was the honorary chair of theJohn F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Because of political tension with the arts communities, she was not initially active in the role. She made her first appearances at the Kennedy Center in 2019.[202]Tribulations in early 2018A scandal broke in January 2018 when it was alleged that Donald hadhad an extramarital affairwith the pornographic actressStormy Daniels. The affair was said to have taken place in July 2006, after the Trumps\\' marriage and the birth of their son. Melania\\'s public appearances became more infrequent after the news emerged, and she canceled several events that she was to attend with her husband.[203]This included the2018 State of the Union Address, where Melania made the unprecedented decision to ride separately from him on the way there.[204]Michael Cohen, who had arranged the silencing of the alleged affair, stated that his greatest regret was lying to Melania, saying that she didn\\'t deserve it.[205]The next month, the story of a second affair in 2006 with the modelKaren McDougalwas made public.[203][206]To Melania, the worst part was that she felt Donald had publicly humiliated her.[207][163]Left to right:Brigitte Macron, Melania Trump,Emmanuel Macron,Donald TrumpMelania learned in April 2018 that she was afflicted with kidney disease, but she only told her parents, her husband, and her sister.[208]On May 14, she began treatment atWalter Reed National Military Medical Center.[209]While her husband had wished to join her, his presence would have risked the press discovering her condition.[210]The official statement said that she underwent anembolization, aminimally invasive procedurethat deliberately blocks a blood vessel.[211][211]A statement was released after the procedure was finished without complication,[209]and she recovered in the hospital over the following five days.[212]The extended stay led to false rumors and conspiracy theories that she had gottenplastic surgery.[213][214]After leaving the hospital, she continued to stay out of the public eye until the beginning of June.[215]At this point, the president let slip that the surgery had been more serious than initially suggested.[216]Those around Melania noticed that she was generally happier by mid-2018. By this time, she had reached a more advantageous marital agreement that ensured Barron would be given a fair inheritance.[217]Her public position, and the corresponding influence she had over her husband\\'s political career, had given her the advantage in negotiations.[218]After several months of problems, Melania received positive coverage for a large custom-made white hat that she wore during a visit by French presidentEmmanuel Macron.[219]On August 9, 2018, Melania\\'s parents were granted American citizenship. This revitalized accusations of hypocrisy by the Trumps regarding Melania\\'s parents, as Donald had spoken out against the chain migration process that allowed them to enter the United States.[220]2018 Africa tourMelania Trump wearing apith helmetin KenyaIn October 2018, Melania took a tour of Africa without Donald, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt. She spent much of her time with children in schools, orphanages, and hospitals. She used the trip to tout relief work being carried out by theUnited States Agency for International Development, which raised questions about her husband\\'s intention to cut its funding. Melania also received criticism for her fashion choices, where a photo opportunity in front of theGreat Sphinx of Gizawas seen as exploitive and apith helmetshe wore in Kenya was criticized for its association withcolonialism in Africa. To these criticisms, she responded that people should pay more attention to her actions instead of her outfits.[221]Perception of the trip grew worse when she responded to criticisms by saying that she was \"the most bullied person in the world\".[222]Throughout Melania\\'s tour of Africa, personality conflicts took place between her team andMira Ricardel, theDeputy National Security Advisor.[223]Ricardel\\'s staffer had been bumped from the first lady\\'s plane on the flight to Africa to make room for a journalist, and Ricardel subsequently became less cooperative with providing logistical information needed for the tour.[224]Upon returning, Ricardel gave a thoroughly negative report on Melania\\'s staff, describing them as embarrassing the White House with their partying.[225]Melania twice complained to the president, but no immediate action was taken.[225]So the following month, the Office of the First Lady issued an official statement calling for Ricardel to be removed from her position. Publicly commenting on such a thing was unprecedented for a first lady.[226]No one in the administration had been told in advance about the statement, including the president.[225]Ricardel was fired the following day.[227]A dispute over the trip arose between Melania and Ivanka a few months later when the latter made her own trip to the continent. Melania felt that in taking such a similar trip, Ivanka was intruding on the first lady\\'s role.[228]Political influenceMelania Trump working with children at a 2017 Christmas event; children\\'s welfare was among the most important issues to Melania.Melania was the one person exempt from the criticism and distrust that Donald leveled against those around him in the White House. He held her opinion in high regard, often agreeing with her when she made it known, and he valued her loyalty as she did not seek public attention of her own.[229]Melania believed that it was not her duty as first lady to take policy positions in her own right, but simply to advise Donald regarding his.[11]She was the only person among those around him who could critique him directly without repercussion.[230]Donald frequently asked for her opinion about issues he was considering or people who he interacted with, calling her over the phone when she was not in the same room.[231]Melania paid close attention to media coverage throughout Donald\\'s presidency, providing her input on what would make good optics and maintain his image.[232][233]She also provided advice on how to pose for pictures and has given him suggestions on how to appear when moving.[234]The nature of their relationship allowed Melania to overlook erratic behavior from Donald, as she had long believed that there was no use in trying to change someone\\'s personality, especially her husband\\'s.[180]Melania had influence over her husband\\'s staff, and Donald sometimes fired individuals on her advice.[186][235]The welfare of children is a subject of interest for her, and she routinely made visits to children\\'s hospitals throughout her tenure as first lady.[236]According to her biographer Kate Bennett, interacting with children is one of the rare things that causes Melania to shift away from her usual stoic demeanor.[237]Her advocacy was a major factor in her husband\\'s decision to ban fruit flavoredelectronic cigarettes.[238]About one year into her tenure, Melania hired Reagan Thompson as a policy advisor, though she had yet to adopt any official initiatives at the time.[239]Family separation policyMelania was openly critical of her husband\\'s\"zero tolerance\" policy of denying asylumat theMexico–United States borderin 2018, where children were being separated from their parents. Her official position was that she hated to see families separated and hoped for successful immigration reform.[240][241]Out of public view, she made her opposition clear to the president and influenced his decision to end it.[242]Leaked tapes in 2020 featured Melania making statements defending some of the practices, expressing grief about family separation but questioning the validity ofasylum claimsand dismissing concerns that children were kept in substandard conditions.[243]Melania was upset when her stepdaughter Ivanka began receiving the credit for changing the president\\'s mind on the issue.[244]Melania decided to visit the border herself, ignoring her husband\\'s worries about keeping media attention on the border and the Secret Service\\'s need of advance notice to plan her trip.[245]She arrived at the border on June 21, where she visited the family separation facilities in Texas and attended aroundtablewith doctors, medical staff, social workers, and other experts at Upbring New Hope Children\\'s Shelter.[246]On the way to the border facility, she caused controversy by wearing a jacket that read, \"I really don\\'t care, do u?\" After much speculation about the jacket\\'s message, including criticism that she may have been expressing indifference toward the families separated at the border, Melania stated that the jacket was aimed at people and media who were criticizing her.[247]The jacket dominated media coverage of her visit.[248]Be Best campaignMain article:Be BestMelania Trump celebrating the second anniversary of the Be Best campaignOn May 7, 2018, Melania held a press conference in theWhite House Rose Gardento announce her official public initiative as first lady, the Be Best awareness campaign. The initiative was created to support the welfare of children, advocate againstcyberbullying, and preventopioid abuse.[212][249]The initiative\\'s name drew ridicule in the press for its grammatical structure.[250]Instead of creating new programs like previous first ladies\\' projects, Be Best promoted existing initiatives and organizations that worked toward the cause. Public awareness of the initiative remained low, and it was often regarded solely as an anti-cyberbullying campaign.[251]The Be Best campaign drew criticism for its perceived hypocrisy, challenging cyberbullying when her husband was well known for attacking people online.[252][251]Even Donald had warned her before the campaign\\'s launch that the contrast may provoke criticism.[251]She acknowledged the discrepancy but insisted that she would continue because she felt it was a good cause.[252]This received more attention in 2019 when the president made Twitter posts critical ofGreta Thunberg, a teenage environmental activist diagnosed on theautism spectrum. This came days after Melania had criticizedPamela Karlanfor invoking Barron in a speech against the president. The first lady\\'s office responded that spouses can have different communication styles, and said that Barron was not \"an activist who travels the globe giving speeches\".[253]COVID-19 and 2020 presidential campaignMelania Trump with first responders during theCOVID-19 pandemicMelania carried out a major reorganization of her staff in April 2020 in anticipation ofher husband\\'s reelection campaign. She appointed Marcia Lee Kelly as her senior advisor andEmma Doyleas her policy advisor. Melania\\'s chief of staff, Lindsay Reynolds, was removed; her responsibilities went to Melania\\'s communications director, Stephanie Grisham.[183]Melania became an active campaigner for her husband during the2020 presidential election, which was a strong contrast to her 2016 activity.[254]When theCOVID-19 pandemicbegan, Melania was criticized for promoting a White House renovation project. She took the topic more seriously after theCOVID-19 lockdownsbegan, using her Twitter account to encouragesocial distancing during the pandemicand promote official medical advice. Much of what she posted directly contradicted what her husband posted, as he discouraged many of the recommended practices.[255][256]On October 1, 2020, Melania\\'s former advisor Stephanie Winston Wolkoff released audiotapes that featured Melania making profane statements about her image and role as first lady. In the tapes, she condemned the media for not giving her positive coverage, questioned why people wanted her to speak out against her husband when she supported his policies, and expressed frustration with her responsibility to oversee Christmas decorations in the White House. She also mentioned her \"I really don\\'t care, do u\" jacket in the tapes, admitting that she wore it to irritateliberals. Winston Wolkoff had released the tapes alongside atell-allbook,Melania and Me.[243][257]The Justice Department filed acivil suitagainst Winston Wolkoff in October 2019, alleging breach of anondisclosure agreement, but it was dropped in February 2021 under the Biden administration.[258]In September 2022, Melania said in an interview withBreitbart Newsthat the audiotapes had been strategically edited to make people believe that her duties in the White House had been unimportant to her.[259]Despite Donald\\'s loss of the 2020 election,[260]Melania ended her tenure by endorsing his false statement that he had been the legitimate election winner.[191][222]For her final months in the White House, she stopped visiting her office in the East Wing and remained in the White House residence. Her focus at this time was on compiling photo albums of the decorations and renovations she had overseen through her tenure.[191]Melania was managing photography at the White House when theJanuary 6 United States Capitol attacktook place and gave no comment at the time. She later said that she would have commented if she had been \"fully informed of all the details\".[163]Her communications director Stephanie Grisham later stated she had sent Melania a text message asking her to make a statement condemning the violence and resigned when that did not happen.[191]On January 18, Melania released a farewell video asking the American people to uphold the principles of her Be Best campaign.[222]She did not contact incoming first ladyJill Bidento make transition arrangements or provide her the traditional tour of the White House.[222]She did, however, follow the tradition of leaving a letter for the incoming first lady.[191]As her husband, Donald Trump, was elected to the presidency for a second, non-consecutive term on November 5, 2024, Trump will return to her role as First Lady in January 2025.[261]After the White House (2021–present)After the Trumps left the White House, Melania returned to Mar-a-Lago, where she could live while avoiding public attention.[163]She retained one White House advisor, Marcia Lee Kelly, to help her during the post-presidency.[222]Melania kept in contact with her successor Jill Biden, and the two have exchanged birthday cards.[191]Since her tenure as first lady ended, Melania has made occasional paid speaking appearances, she has founded a scholarship program forfoster children, and she has minted a line ofApollo 11–themednon-fungible tokensthat were not in compliance withNASA\\'s image use policy.[163]In November 2023, Melania attended the memorial service for former First LadyRosalynn Carter.[262]Melania remained out of public view during her husband\\'scourt appearancesandhis candidacyin the2024 presidential election, limiting her campaign events to two fundraisers for theLog Cabin Republicans. She became more visible in July 2024 by putting out a statement following theattempted assassination of her husbandand appearing at the2024 Republican National Convention, though she declined an invitation to speak at the event, making her the first candidate\\'s spouse not to speak at the convention sinceBarbara Bushbegan the tradition.[263]In the same month, Melania announced her intention to publish amemoir, titledMelania.[264]She caused controversy among Republicans in the lead up to the book\\'s publication when she announced her support for theright to abortion.[265]Donald was reelected president in November 2024. Uponhis second inauguration, Melania will become the second first lady to hold the position two times non-consecutively, afterFrances Cleveland.[266]Public imageMain article:Public image of Melania TrumpA2017 Women\\'s Marchprotester with a Free Melania signMelania limits her interactions with the public, creating a public image heavily influenced by speculation.[267]She worked to protect her privacy as first lady,[268]and her staff was instructed not to answer any questions about her whereabouts at a given time.[181]With limited information, commentators have portrayed her as being a reluctant companion to her husband or as a woman who has no independence of her own. Several incidents during her husband\\'s presidency led to rumors that she had a secret animosity toward her husband, such as her delay in moving to the White House and allegations that he had committed adultery.[213][268][269]The rumors led to popular use of thehashtag#FreeMelania by those who believed them.[270]Though she disliked the idea that people saw her as helpless, Melania found the campaign amusing.[271]This became less common by 2020 as she had become more publicly associated with the role of first lady.[272]She is often seen as cold by the public, though people who interact with her describe her as a warm presence.[4][273]As with previous first ladies, Melania\\'s fashion was heavily scrutinized, and particularly expensive pieces were criticized.[189]More than other first ladies, her fashion was scrutinized in the context of her past as a fashion model and her marriage to a billionaire.[274]She did her own clothes shopping,[275][276]but she was assisted by designerHervé Pierre,[277]hair stylist Mordechai Alvow, and make up artist Nicole Byrl.[278]When preparing for speeches, she dedicated more attention to her physical appearance than content or delivery, which her staff felt affected her ability to promote her causes.[279]Despite her experience in fashion, she disliked that it was such a major aspect of news coverage about her as first lady.[280]Melania has been seen by the American public as the first foreigner first lady. The only other first lady to be born outside of the United States had an American father.[281]Having a Slovenian-born woman as the American first lady became a point of national pride in Slovenia, and it gave the nation a sense of recognition on the world stage.[282][283]Melania\\'s hometown Sevnica has developed a small tourist industry around her, and Melania-themed merchandise was common during her tenure as first lady. These items never used Melania\\'s full name, substituting it with \"first lady\" or \"M\", as she is protective of herpersonality rights.[284]During the 2016 presidential election, Melania became the only candidate\\'s spouse since polling began in 1988 to have a disapproval rating greater than their approval rating.[285]Her approval rating stood at 36 or 37% in the months leading up to becoming first lady in January 2017,[286][153]but it increased to 57% in a CNN poll in April 2018 after she received public sympathy amid allegations that her husband had committed adultery.[239][287]Melania finished her tenure in 2021 as the least popular first lady since polling began with a rating of 42%.[288]Multiple polls during her tenure as first lady showed her as the most popular member of the Trump family.[286][289][290]In December 2020, theSiena College Research Institutereleased a study surveying scholars and historians on their assessments of American first ladies. It was the fifth such first ladies study that the Institute had conducted since 1982, and the first in which Melania appeared. She was ranked as being the worst of 40 assessed American first ladies,[291]receiving the lowest assessments in all of the metrics that were weighed.[292]Footnotes^Pronounced/məˈlɑːniə/mə-LAH-nee-ə^Name prior to her marriage:Melania Knauss(German:[meˈlaːni̯aˈknaʊs]), aGermanizationof her Slovene birth nameMelanija Knavs(Slovene:[mɛˈlaːnijaˈknaːws]).^Frances Clevelandwas the first, serving in the role from 1886 to 1889 and again from 1893 to 1897.Notes^\"Melania Trump votes in N.Y. primary\".The Washington Post.

In October 2024, the men sued Trump for defamation after he said in a televised September debate that they had committed the crime and killed the woman.[28]In 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, Trump became the leading proponent of the racist\"birther\" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the U.S.[29]In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \"long-form\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him \"very popular\".[30]In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[31]In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views privately.[32]Answering questions about the Unite the Right rally in CharlottesvilleTrump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media.[33][34]He made lewd comments, disparaged women\\'s physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[34]At least 25 women publiclyaccused him of sexual misconduct, including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women\\'s skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. He has denied the allegations.[35]In October 2016, a 2005 \"hot mic\" recording surfaced in whichTrump braggedabout kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that \"when you\\'re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ...

Trump\\'s counterclaims were dismissed, and the government\\'s case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate.[113]In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump\\'s properties to furnish theNew York Urban Leaguewith a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.[114]Cohn introduced political consultantRoger Stoneto Trump, who enlisted Stone\\'s services to deal with the federal government.[115]According to a review of state and federal court files conducted byUSA Todayin 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[116]While he has not filed forpersonal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed forChapter 11 bankruptcyprotection six times between 1991 and 2009.[117]They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties.[117]During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4\\xa0billion.[118]After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.[119]After theJanuary\\xa06 Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with him or his company in the future.[120]WealthMain article:Wealth of Donald TrumpTrump (rightmost) and wife Ivana in the receiving line of a state dinner for KingFahd of Saudi Arabiain 1985, with U.S. presidentRonald Reaganand First LadyNancy ReaganIn 1982, Trump made the initialForbeslist of wealthy people for holding a share of his family\\'s estimated $200\\xa0million net worth (equivalent to $631\\xa0million in 2023).[82]His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.[121]After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with theFECin July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10\\xa0billion.

Roberts Jr.atthe Capitol, January\\xa020, 2017.Trump was inauguratedon January\\xa020, 2017. During his first week in office, he signedsix executive orders, authorizing interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of theMexico City policy, advancement of theKeystone XLandDakota Access Pipelineconstruction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[202]Trump\\'s daughter Ivanka and son-in-lawJared Kushnerbecame hisassistantandsenior advisor, respectively.[203][204]Conflicts of interestSee also:First presidency of Donald Trump Â§\\xa0EthicsBefore being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into arevocable trust,[205][206]rather than ablind trustor equivalent arrangement \"to cleanly sever himself from his business interests\".[207]He continued to profit from his businesses and to know how his administration\\'s policies affected his businesses.[206][208]Although he said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Scotland, Dubai, and the Dominican Republic.[206][208]Lobbyists, foreign government officials, and Trump donors and allies generated hundreds of millions of dollars for his resorts and hotels.[209]Trump was sued for violating theDomesticandForeign Emoluments Clausesof theU.S. Constitution, marking the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated.[210]One case was dismissed in lower court.[211]Two were dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court as moot after the end of his term.[212]Domestic policyMain articles:Economic policy of the first Donald Trump administration,Environmental policy of the first Donald Trump administration, andSocial policy of Donald TrumpTrump took office at the height of the longesteconomic expansionin American history,[213]which began in 2009 and continued until February 2020, when theCOVID-19 recessionbegan.[214]In December 2017, Trump signed theTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals and set the penalty associated with theAffordable Care Act\\'s individual mandate to $0.[215][216]The Trump administration claimed that the act would not decrease government revenue, but 2018 revenues were 7.6\\xa0percent lower than projected.[217]Under Trump, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50\\xa0percent, to nearly $1\\xa0trillion in 2019.[218]By the end of his term, theU.S. national debtincreased by 39\\xa0percent, reaching $27.75\\xa0trillion, and the U.S.debt-to-GDP ratiohit a post-World War II high.[219]Trump also failed to deliver the $1\\xa0trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[220]Trump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3\\xa0million people.[213][221]Trump rejects thescientific consensus on climate change.[222][223][224][225]He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40\\xa0percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[226]Hewithdrew from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation to not ratify it.[227]Trump aimed to boost the production and exports offossil fuels.[228][229]Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[230][231]He rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbedgreenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowingdrilling in the Arctic Refuge.[232]In 2017, Trump signedExecutive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies \"identify\" two existing regulations for elimination, although it did not require elimination.[233]He dismantled many federal regulations on health,[234][235]labor,[236][235]and the environment,[237][235]among others, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[238]During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[239]often \"after requests by the regulated industries\".[240]TheInstitute for Policy Integrityfound that 78\\xa0percent of his proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[241]During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace theAffordable Care Act.[242]In office, he scaled back the Act\\'s implementation through executive orders.[243][244]He expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration halved theenrollment periodand drastically reduced funding for enrollment promotion.[245][246]In June 2018, the Trump administrationjoined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Courtthat the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the Act unconstitutional.[247][248]Their pleading would have eliminatedhealth insurance coveragefor up to 23\\xa0million Americans, but was unsuccessful.[247]During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs. In January 2020, he expressed willingness to consider cuts to them.[249]In response to theopioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a record 50,052 in 2019.[250]Trump barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.[251]He said he supported \"traditional marriage\", but considered thenationwide legalityofsame-sex marriage\"settled\".[252]His administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration\\'s workplace protections againstdiscrimination of LGBTQ people.[253]His attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections fortransgenderpatients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after a Supreme Court ruling extended employees\\' civil rights protections togender identityand sexual orientation.[254]Trump has said he isopposedtogun control, although his views have shifted over time.[255]After severalmass shootingsduring his term, he said he would propose legislation related to guns, but he abandoned that effort in November 2019.[256]His administration took ananti-marijuana position, revokingObama-era policiesthat provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.[257]Trump is a long-time advocate of capital punishment.[258][259]Under his administration, thefederal government executed13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined, ending a 17-year moratorium.[260]In 2016, he said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such aswaterboarding.[261][262]Race relationsTrump\\'s comments on the 2017Unite the Right rally, condemning \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides\" and stating that there were \"very fine people on both sides\", were criticized as implying amoral equivalencebetween thewhite supremacistdemonstrators and the counter-protesters.[263]In a January 2018 discussion of immigration legislation, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \"shithole countries\".[264]His remarks were condemned as racist.[265]In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomenâ€”all from minorities, three of whom are native-born Americansâ€”should \"go back\" to the countries they \"came from\".[266]Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240â€“187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \"racist comments\".[267]White nationalistpublications and social media praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.[268]He continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.[269]Trump and group of officials and advisors on the way from the White House to St. John\\'s ChurchIn June 2020, during theGeorge Floyd protests, federal law-enforcement officials controversially usedless lethalweapons to remove a largely peaceful crowd of lawful protesters fromLafayette Square, outside theWhite House.[270][271]Trump then posed with a Bible fora photo-opat the nearbySt. John\\'s Episcopal Church,[270][272][273]with religious leaders condemning both the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[274]Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned his proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[275]Pardons and commutationsFurther information:List of people granted executive clemency by Donald TrumpTrump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception ofGeorge H. W. BushandGeorge W. Bush.[276]Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department\\'sOffice of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.[277][278]In his last full day in office, he granted 73 pardons and commuted 70 sentences.[279]Several Trump allies were not eligible for pardons under Justice Department rules, and in other cases the department had opposed clemency.[277]The pardons of three military service members convicted of or charged with violent crimes were opposed by military leaders.[280]ImmigrationMain article:Immigration policy of Donald TrumpAs president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gangMS-13.[281]Trump drastically escalated immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.[282][283]From 2018 onward, Trumpdeployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.â€“Mexico border[284]to stop most Central American migrants from seeking asylum. In 2020, his administration widened thepublic charge ruleto further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency.[285]He reduced the number ofrefugees admittedto record lows. When he took office, the annual limit was 110,000; he set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year.[286][287]Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted than the allowed limits.[288]Travel banMain article:Trump travel banFurther information:Executive Order 13769andExecutive Order 13780Following the2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump proposed to banMuslimforeigners from entering the U.S. until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[289]He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[290]On January\\xa027, 2017, Trump signedExecutive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning, causing chaos at airports.[291][292]Protests began at airportsthe next day,[291][292]andlegal challengesresulted innationwide preliminary injunctions.[293]A March\\xa06revised order, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, again was blocked by federal judges in three states.[294][295]In adecision in June 2017, theSupreme Courtruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of abona fiderelationship with a person or entity in the United States\".[296]The temporary order was replaced byPresidential Proclamation 9645on September\\xa024, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[297]After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December\\xa04, 2017,[298]and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a ruling in June 2019.[299]Family separation at the borderMain article:Trump administration family separation policyChildren sitting within a wire mesh compartment in theUrsula detention facilityinMcAllen, Texas, June 2018The Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.â€“Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[300][301]In April 2018, the administration announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy whereby adults suspected ofillegal entrywere to be detained and criminally prosecuted while their children were taken away as unaccompanied alien minors.[302][303]The policy was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage.[304][305]Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration\\'s policy.[306][307][308]Although Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he acceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order in June 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" of a risk to the child.[309][310]On June\\xa026, 2018, JudgeDana Sabrawconcluded that the Trump administration had \"no system in place to keep track of\" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification;[311]Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances.[312]After the order, the administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; theACLUcontended that the administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.[301]Trump wall and government shutdownMain articles:Trump walland2018â€“2019 United States federal government shutdownTrump examines border wall prototypes inOtay Mesa, California.One of Trump\\'s central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600\\xa0km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.[313]By the end of his term, the U.S. had built \"40 miles [64\\xa0km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53\\xa0km] of secondary wall\" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587\\xa0km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.[314]In 2018, Trump refused to sign anyappropriations billfrom Congress unless it allocated $5.6\\xa0billion for the border wall,[315]resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, thelongest U.S. government shutdown in history.[316][317]Around 800,000 government employees werefurloughedor worked without pay.[318]Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers, but no funds for the wall.[316]The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3\\xa0billion to the economy, according to theCongressional Budget Office.[319]About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and his approval ratings dropped.[320]To prevent another imminent shutdown in February 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a funding bill that included $1.375\\xa0billion for 55 miles (89\\xa0km) of bollard border fencing.[321]He also declared anational emergency on the southern border, intending to divert $6.1\\xa0billion of funds Congress had allocated to other purposes.[321]He vetoedajoint resolutionto overturn the declaration, and the Senate voted against aveto override.[322]Legal challenges to the diversion of $2.5\\xa0billion originally meant for theDepartment of Defense\\'s drug interdiction efforts[323][324]and $3.6\\xa0billion originally meant for military construction[325][326]were unsuccessful.Foreign policyMain article:Foreign policy of the first Donald Trump administrationSee also:List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump Â§\\xa0First presidency (2017â€“2021)Trump with the otherG7leaders at the45th summitin France, 2019Trump described himself as a \"nationalist\"[327]and his foreign policy as \"America First\".[328]He praised and supportedpopulist,neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments.[329]Hallmarks of foreign relations during his tenure included unpredictability, uncertainty, and inconsistency.[328][330]Tensions between the U.S. and its European allies were strained under Trump.[331]He criticizedNATO alliesand privately suggested on multiple occasions that the U.S. shouldwithdraw from NATO.[332][333]TradeSee also:Trump tariffsTrump withdrew the U.S. from theTrans-Pacific Partnership(TPP) negotiations,[334]imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[335]and launched atrade war with Chinaby sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50\\xa0billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[336]While he said that import tariffs are paid by China into theU.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.[337]Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.\\'s largetrade deficits, the trade deficit skyrocketed under Trump.[338]Following a 2017â€“2018 renegotiation, theUnited Statesâ€“Mexicoâ€“Canada Agreement(USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.[339]RussiaSee also:Russiaâ€“United States relations Â§\\xa0First Trump administration (2017â€“2021)Vladimir Putinand Trump shaking hands at theG20 Osaka summit, June 2019The Trump administration weakened the toughest sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Russian entities after Russia\\'s2014 annexation of Crimea.[340][341]Trump withdrew the U.S. from theIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian noncompliance,[342]and supported a potential return of Russia to theG7.[343]Trump repeatedly praised and rarely criticized Russian presidentVladimir Putin[344][345]but opposed some actions of the Russian government.[346][347]After he met Putin at theHelsinki Summitin 2018, he drew bipartisan criticism for accepting Putin\\'s denial ofRussian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies.[348][349][350]He did not discuss allegedRussian bountiesoffered toTalibanfighters for attacking American soldiers in Afghanistan with Putin, saying both that he doubted the intelligence and that he was not briefed on it.[351]East AsiaChina, Hong Kong, TaiwanSee also:Chinaâ€“United States relations Â§\\xa0First Trump administration (2017â€“2021)Trump and Chinese leaderXi Jinpingat theG20 Buenos Aires summit, December 2018Trump repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S.[352]Helaunched a trade war against Chinathat was widely characterized as a failure,[353][354]sanctionedHuaweifor alleged ties to Iran,[355]significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars,[356]and classified China as acurrency manipulator.[357]He also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise ofChinese Communist PartyleaderXi Jinping,[358]which was attributed to trade war negotiations.[359]After initially praising China forits handling of COVID-19,[360]he began a campaign of criticism starting in March 2020.[361]Trump said he resisted punishing China forits human rights abusesagainst ethnic minorities in theXinjiangregion for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations.[362]In July 2020,his administration imposed sanctionsand visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, in response to expanded massdetention campsholding more than a million of the country\\'sUyghurminority.[363]North KoreaSee also:North Koreaâ€“United States relations Â§\\xa0First Trump administration (2017â€“2021),2017â€“2018 North Korea crisis, and2018â€“19 Korean peace processTrump and North Korean leaderKim Jong Unat theSingapore summit, June 2018In 2017, whenNorth Korea\\'s nuclear weaponswere increasingly seen as a serious threat,[364]Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\".[365][366]In 2017, he declared that he wanted North Korea\\'s \"complete denuclearization\", and engaged inname-callingwith leaderKim Jong Un.[365][367]After this period of tension, he and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship.[368][369]In March 2019, he lifted some U.S.sanctions against North Koreaagainst the advice of his Treasury Department.[370]Trump, the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, met Kim three times:in Singaporein 2018,in Hanoiin 2019, andin the Korean Demilitarized Zonein 2019.[371]However, nodenuclearizationagreement was reached,[372]and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.[373]While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles.[374][375]Middle EastAfghanistanU.S. Secretary of StateMike Pompeomeeting with Taliban delegation inQatarin September 2020U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,[376]reversing Trump\\'s preelection position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[377]In February 2020, his administration signed apeace agreement with the Taliban, which called for thewithdrawal of foreign troopsin 14 months \"contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies\" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000Talibanimprisoned by the Afghan government.[378][379][380]By the end of his term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integratingAl-Qaedamembers into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.[380]IsraelTrump supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu.[381]Under Trump, the U.S.recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel[382]andIsraeli sovereigntyover theGolan Heights,[383]leading to international condemnation including from theUN General Assembly,European Union, andArab League.[384][385]In 2020, the White House hosted the signing of agreements, namedAbraham Accords, between Israel and theUnited Arab EmiratesandBahrainto normalize their foreign relations.[386]Saudi ArabiaTrump, KingSalman of Saudi Arabia, and Egyptian presidentAbdel Fattah el-Sisiat the2017 Riyadh summitin Saudi ArabiaTrump actively supported theSaudi Arabianâ€“led intervention in Yemenagainst theHouthisand in 2017 signed a $110\\xa0billion agreement to sell arms toSaudi Arabia.[387]In 2018, the U.S. provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention.[388][389]Following the2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed onIran, he approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, twoPatriot batteries, and aTerminal High Altitude Area Defensesystem, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.[390]SyriaTrump and Turkish presidentRecep Tayyip ErdoÄŸanat the White House in May 2017Trump orderedmissile strikes in April 2017andApril 2018against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for theKhan ShaykhunandDouma chemical attacks, respectively.[391][392]In December 2018, he declared \"we have won against ISIS\", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria.[393][394]The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling Trump\\'s decision an abandonment of the U.S.\\'sKurdish allieswho played a key role in fighting ISIS.[395]In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish presidentRecep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan,U.S. troops in northern Syriawere withdrawn from the area and Turkeyinvaded northern Syria, attacking anddisplacingAmerican-alliedKurds.[396]The U.S. House of Representatives voted 354â€“60 to condemn Trump\\'s withdrawal of those U.S. troops from Syria.[397][398]IranIn May 2018, Trumpwithdrew the U.S.from theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 agreement that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for restrictions onIran\\'s nuclear program.[399][400]In August 2020, his administration unsuccessfully attempted to use a section of the nuclear deal to have the UN reimpose sanctions against Iran.[401]Analysts determined that, after the U.S. withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.[402][403]On January\\xa01, 2020, Trump ordereda U.S. airstrikethat killed Iranian generalQasem Soleimani, who had planned nearly every significant Iranian andIranian-backedoperation over the preceding two decades.[404][405]One week later, Iran retaliated withballistic missile strikes against two U.S. airbasesin Iraq. Dozens of soldiers sustained traumatic brain injuries. He downplayed their injuries, and they were initially deniedPurple Heartmedals and the benefits accorded to their recipients.[406][402]PersonnelMain articles:Political appointments by Donald TrumpandFirst cabinet of Donald TrumpThe Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of his first year in office, 34\\xa0percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[407]As of early July\\xa02018[update], 61\\xa0percent of his senior aides had left[408]and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[409]Both figures set a record for recent presidentsâ€”more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[410]Notable early departures included National Security AdvisorMichael Flynn(after just 25 days), and Press SecretarySean Spicer.[410]Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon,Hope Hicks,John McEntee, andKeith Schillerquit or were forced out.[411]Some later returned in different posts.[412]He publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[413]Trump had fourWhite House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several.[414]Reince Priebuswas replaced after seven months by retired Marine generalJohn F. Kelly.[415]Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and Trump subsequently disparaged him.[416]Kelly was succeeded byMick Mulvaneyas acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 byMark Meadows.[414]On May\\xa09, 2017, Trumpdismissed FBI director James Comey. While initially attributing this action to Comey\\'s conduct in the investigation aboutHillary Clinton\\'s emails, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey\\'s role in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[417]At a private conversation in February, he said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn.[418]In March and April, he asked Comey to \"lift the cloud impairing his ability to act\" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.[418][419]Trump lost three of his 15 original cabinet members within his first year.[420]Health and Human Services secretaryTom Pricewas forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft.[420][411]Environmental Protection Agency administratorScott Pruittresigned in 2018 and Secretary of the InteriorRyan Zinkein January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.[421][422]Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[423]By January\\xa08, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61\\xa0percent) and he had no nominee for 264 (37\\xa0percent).[424]JudiciaryFurther information:List of federal judges appointed by Donald TrumpandDonald Trump judicial appointment controversiesTrump and his third Supreme Court nominee,Amy Coney BarrettTrump appointed 226Article III judges, including 54 to thecourts of appealsandthreeto theSupreme Court:Neil Gorsuch,Brett Kavanaugh, andAmy Coney Barrett.[425]His Supreme Court nominees were noted as having politically shifted the Court to the right.[426][427][428]In the 2016 campaign, he pledged thatRoe v. Wadewould be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and provided the opportunity to appoint two or three anti-abortion justices. He later took credit whenRoewas overturned inDobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.[429][430][431]Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary\\'s constitutional authority. His attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of his statements on thejudicial independenceand public confidence in the judiciary.[432][433][434]COVID-19 pandemicMain article:COVID-19 pandemic in the United StatesFurther information:U.S. federal government response to the COVID-19 pandemicandCommunication of the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemicSee also:Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United StatesInitial responseThe first confirmed case ofCOVID-19in the U.S. was reported on January\\xa020, 2020.[435]The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency byHealth and Human Services (HHS) SecretaryAlex Azaron January\\xa031, 2020.[436]Trump initially ignored persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.[437]Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak.[438]In February 2020 he publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly thaninfluenza, was \"very much under control\", and would soon be over.[439]On March\\xa019, he privately toldBob Woodwardthat he was deliberately \"playing it down, because I don\\'t want to create a panic\".[440]By mid-March, most global financial markets hadseverely contractedin response to the pandemic.[441]On March\\xa06, Trump signed theCoronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3\\xa0billion in emergency funding for federal agencies.[442]On March\\xa011, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) recognized COVID-19 as apandemic,[443]and he announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March\\xa013.[444]That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak \"horrible\" but \"a temporary moment\" and saying there was no financial crisis.[445]On March\\xa013, he declared anational emergency, freeing up federal resources.[446]He claimed that \"anybody that wants a test can get a test\", despite test availability being severely limited.[447]On March 27, he signed theCARES Actâ€”a $2.2 trillioneconomic stimulusbillâ€”into law following bipartisan negotiations in Congress, becoming the largest stimulus in U.S. history.[448][449]On April\\xa022, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration.[450]In late spring and early summer, with infections and deaths continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.[451]White House Coronavirus Task ForceTrump conducts a COVID-19 press briefing with members of theWhite House Coronavirus Task Forceon March\\xa015, 2020.Trump established theWhite House Coronavirus Task Forceon January\\xa029.[452]Beginning in mid-March, he held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,[453]sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.[454]He was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.[455][failed verification]On March\\xa016, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.[456]His repeated use of \"Chinese virus\" and \"China virus\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[457][458]By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration\\'s response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the WHO.[459]The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which he suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;[460]the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.[461][462]In early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, he said the task force would \"indefinitely\" continue.[463]By the end of May, the coronavirus task force\\'s meetings were sharply reduced.[464]World Health OrganizationPrior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the WHO and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[465]His administration\\'s proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[465]In May and April, he accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging\" COVID-19, alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government\\'s concealment of the pandemic\\'s origins,[465][466][467]and announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[465]These were seen as attempts to distract from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[465][468][469]In July 2020, he announced the formal withdrawal of the U.S. from the WHO, effective July 2021.[466][467]The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \"short-sighted\", \"senseless\", and \"dangerous\".[466][467]Pressure to abandon pandemic mitigation measuresFurther information:COVID-19 testing in the United StatesIn April 2020, Republican-connected groups organizedanti-lockdown protestsagainst the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[470][471]Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[472]although the targeted states did not meet his administration\\'s guidelines for reopening.[473]In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized,GeorgiaGovernorBrian Kemp\\'s plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.[474]Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions to reverse the damage to the country\\'s economy.[475]He often refused tomaskat public events, contrary to his administration\\'s April 2020 guidance to wear masks in public[476]and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing spread of the virus.[477]By June, he had said masks were a \"double-edged sword\"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.[477]His contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.[476][477]In June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \"makes us look bad\".[478][479]The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be \"quickly identified and tested\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.[480][481]In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.[482][483]The day after thispolitical interferencewas reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation.[483]Despite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99\\xa0percent of COVID-19 cases are \"totally harmless\".[484][485]He began insisting that all states should resume in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases.[486]Political pressure on health agenciesMain article:Political interference with science agencies by the first Trump administrationTrump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[482]such as approving unproven treatments[487][488]or speeding up vaccine approvals.[488]Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined his claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[489][490]Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \"deep state\" opposing him and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[491]Outbreak at the White HouseMain article:White House COVID-19 outbreakTrump boardsMarine Onefor COVID-19 treatment on October\\xa02, 2020On October\\xa02, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive forCOVID-19, part of a White House outbreak.[492]Later that dayhe was hospitalizedatWalter Reed National Military Medical Center, reportedly due to fever and labored breathing. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October\\xa05, still infectious and unwell.[493][494]During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus.[493]In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case.[494]In January 2021, he received a COVID-19 vaccination.[495]Effects on the 2020 presidential campaignBy July 2020, Trump\\'s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue in the presidential election.[496]Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue.[497]Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[496]and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with anIpsos/ABC Newspoll indicating 65\\xa0percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.[498]In the final months of the campaign, he repeatedly said that the U.S. was \"rounding the turn\" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing cases and deaths.[499]A few days before the November\\xa03 election, the U.S. reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[500]InvestigationsAfter he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, hisprivate businesses, personal taxes, andcharitable foundation.[501]There were ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[502]FinancialIn April 2019, theHouse Oversight Committeeissuedsubpoenasseeking financial details from Trump\\'s banks, Deutsche Bank andCapital One, and his accounting firm,Mazars USA. He sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chairElijah Cummingsto prevent the disclosures.[503]In May,DC District CourtjudgeAmit Mehtaruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[504]and judgeEdgardo Ramosof theSouthern District Court of New Yorkruled that the banks must also comply.[505][506]Trump\\'s attorneys appealed.[507]In September 2022, the committee and Trump agreed to a settlement about Mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents.[508]Russian election interferenceMain articles:Russian interference in the 2016 United States electionsandTimelines related to Donald Trump and Russian interference in United States electionsSee also:Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential electionandSteele dossierIn January 2017, American intelligence agenciesâ€”theCIA, theFBI, and theNSA, represented by theDirector of National Intelligenceâ€”jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[509][510]In March 2017, FBI DirectorJames Comeytold Congress, \"[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\\'s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\\'s efforts.\"[511]Many suspicious[512]links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spieswere discovered and the relationships between Russians and \"team Trump\", including Manafort, Flynn, and Stone, were widely reported by the press.[513][514][515][516]Members of Trump\\'s campaign and his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the election.[517][518]On December\\xa029, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian AmbassadorSergey Kislyakabout sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence.[519]Trump told Kislyak andSergei Lavrovin May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[520]Trump and his allies promoteda conspiracy theorythat Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 electionâ€”which was also promoted by Russia toframeUkraine.[521]FBI Crossfire Hurricane and 2017 counterintelligence investigationsIn July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamedCrossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.[522]After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump\\'s personal andbusiness dealings with Russia.[523]Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,[524]but Deputy Attorney GeneralRod Rosensteinended the investigation into Trump\\'s direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that theRobert Mueller\\'s special counsel investigation would pursue the matter.[525][526]Mueller investigationMain articles:Mueller special counsel investigation,Mueller report, andCriminal charges brought in the Mueller special counsel investigationIn May 2017, Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Muellerspecial counselfor theDepartment of Justice(DOJ), ordering him to \"examine \\'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government\\' and the Trump campaign\". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters \"in connection with Russia\\'s 2016 election interference\".[525]The special counsel also investigated whether Trump\\'sdismissal of James Comeyas FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[527]and the Trump campaign\\'s possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,Turkey,Qatar, Israel, and China.[528]Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times, but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[529]In March 2019, Mueller gavehis final reportto Attorney GeneralWilliam Barr,[530]which Barr purported to summarizein a letter to Congress. A federal court, and Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation\\'s conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public.[531][532][533]Trump repeatedly claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not.[534]A redacted version of the report, publicly released in April 2019, found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump.[535]Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the report found that the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[536][537]The report revealed sweeping Russian interference[537]and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing it would benefit them electorally.[538][539][540][541]The report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump, but \"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\\'s conduct\".[542][543]Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\" as anOffice of Legal Counselopinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted,[544]and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[545]The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".[544]The House of Representatives subsequently launched animpeachment inquiryfollowing theTrumpâ€“Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.[546][547]Several Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller\\'s investigation and related cases, including Manafort[548]and Flynn.[549][550]Trump\\'s former attorneyMichael Cohenpleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\\'s 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to builda Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump.[551]In February 2020, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering. The sentencing judge said Stone \"was prosecuted for covering up for the president\".[552]First impeachmentMain articles:First impeachment of Donald TrumpandTrumpâ€“Ukraine scandalMembers of House of Representatives vote on twoarticles of impeachment(H.Res.\\xa0755), December\\xa018, 2019In August 2019, awhistleblowerfiled a complaint with theInspector General of the Intelligence Communityabout a July\\xa025 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his sonHunter.[553]The whistleblower said that the White House had attempted to cover up the incident and that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Trump attorneyRudy Giulianithat may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence\\'s May 2019 Ukraine trip.[554]House SpeakerNancy Pelosiinitiateda formal impeachment inquiryon September\\xa024.[555]Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision.[556][557]On September\\xa025, his administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr.[553][558]The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump\\'s personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[559]In October,William B. Taylor Jr., thechargÃ© d\\'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment to investigate the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[560]He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.[561]On December\\xa013, theHouse Judiciary Committeevoted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: one forabuse of powerand one forobstruction of Congress.[562]After debate, the House of RepresentativesimpeachedTrump on both articles on December\\xa018.[563]Trump displaying the headline \"Trump acquitted\"During the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and asserted that Trump\\'s actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the impeachment process.[564]Trump\\'s lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges, but said that he had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[565]They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because he was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.[565]On January\\xa031, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents.[566]The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.[567]Trump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority. SenatorMitt Romneywas the only Republican who voted to convict him on one charge, the abuse of power.[568]Following his acquittal, he fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.[569]Second impeachmentMain articles:Second impeachment of Donald TrumpandSecond impeachment trial of Donald TrumpSpeaker of the HouseNancy Pelosisigning the second impeachment of TrumpOn January\\xa011, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump withincitement of insurrectionagainst the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[570]The House voted 232â€“197 to impeach him on January\\xa013, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.[571]Ten Republicans voted for the impeachmentâ€”the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[572]On February\\xa013, following afive-day Senate trial, Trump was acquitted when the Senate vote fell ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president.[573][574]Most Republicans voted to acquit him, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (he had left office on January\\xa020; the Senate voted 56â€“44 that the trial was constitutional).[575]2020 presidential electionDefeated by BidenMain articles:2020 United States presidential electionandDonald Trump 2020 presidential campaignBreaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[576]He held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office[577]and officially became theRepublican nomineein August 2020.[578]In his first two years in office, Trump\\'s reelection committee reported raising $67.5\\xa0million and began 2019 with $19.3\\xa0million in cash.[579]By July 2020, his campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1\\xa0billion and spent $800\\xa0million, losing their cash advantage over Biden.[580]The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.[581]Trump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won.[582]He repeatedly misrepresented Biden\\'s positions[583][584]and shifted to appeals to racism.[585]Starting in the spring of 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[586][587]When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25\\xa0billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, he blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail, creating acrisis in the Postal Service.[588]He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results if he lost and commit to apeaceful transition of power.[589][590]Biden won the election on November\\xa03, receiving 81.3\\xa0million votes (51.3\\xa0percent) to Trump\\'s 74.2\\xa0million (46.8\\xa0percent)[591][592]and 306Electoral Collegevotes to Trump\\'s 232.[593]Rejection of resultsFurther information:Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election,2020â€“21 United States election protests, andElection denial movement in the United StatesAt 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[594]After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump stated that \"this election is far from over\" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[595]He and his allies filed manylegal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both thestateandfederal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[596][597]His allegations were also refuted by state election officials.[598]AfterCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security AgencydirectorChris Krebscontradicted Trump\\'s fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November\\xa017.[599]On December\\xa011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to heara case from the Texas attorney generalthat asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[600]Trump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election.[601]He initially blocked government officials from cooperating inBiden\\'s presidential transition.[602][603]After three weeks, the administrator of theGeneral Services Administrationdeclared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[604]Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.[605][606]The Electoral College formalized Biden\\'s victory on December\\xa014.[593]From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help tooverturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders,[607]Republican state and federal legislators,[608]the Justice Department,[609]and Vice President Pence,[610]urging various actions such asreplacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result.[608]On February\\xa010, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump\\'s efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.[611]Trump did not attendBiden\\'s inauguration.[612]January 6 Capitol attackMain article:January 6 United States Capitol attackFor a chronological guide, seeTimeline of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.Trump speaking at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January\\xa06In December 2020,Newsweekreportedthe Pentagonwas on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what to do if Trump declaredmartial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role in the outcome of elections.[613]When Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of StaffMark Milleyand CIA directorGina Haspelbecame concerned about a possiblecoupattempt or military action against China or Iran.[614][615]Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons.[616][617]On January\\xa06, 2021, whilecongressional certification of the presidential election resultswas taking place in the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a noon rally atthe Ellipsein Washington, D.C., where he called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol.[618][619]Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. The mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[620]During the violence, Trump posted messages onTwitterwithout asking the rioters to disperse.

She is the firstnaturalized citizento become first lady, the second foreign-born first lady afterLouisa Adams, and the second Catholic first lady afterJacqueline Kennedy. As her husband was re-elected in the2024 presidential election, Trump is set to return to her role as first lady on January 20, 2025, following her husband\\'ssecond inauguration. She will become the second first lady in history to serve two non-consecutive terms.[c]Melanija Knavs was born in Slovenia—then part ofYugoslavia—where she began working as a fashion model at the age of 16. She changed the spelling of her name toMelania Knauss, and she traveled toParisandMilanto seek modeling work before meetingPaolo Zampolli, who hired her and sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1996. She continued working as a model in Manhattan, where Zampolli introduced her to thereal estate developerDonald Trump in 1998. Melania and Donald began dating shortly afterward. He worked to get her more modeling jobs, and she supported him during his2000 presidential campaign. Melania and Donald Trump married in 2005, and they had a son,Barron Trump, the following year. She dedicated most of her time to Barron during his infancy, spending less time working or accompanying her husband at events. She started her own jewelry brand, Melania, in 2009.After encouraging Donald torun for presidentin the2016 presidential election, Melania only made rare campaign appearances, opting to help Donald strategize over the phone. She received major press coverage during the campaign when erotic photos from her modeling years were uncovered and published, and again when a speech she gave at the2016 Republican National Conventionwas found to be plagiarized from a similar speech byMichelle Obama. In the month leading up to the election, she defended her husband following the release of theAccess Hollywoodtapethat had caused a scandal for her husband.Melania stayed in Manhattan for the first months of her tenure as first lady, allowing Barron to finish school and Melania to renegotiate herprenuptial agreement. Her stepdaughterIvanka Trumpfulfilled some of the first lady\\'s traditional duties. She kept to minimal activity after moving into theWhite House, often staying in the residence instead of her office in theEast Wing, and she held fewer events than previous first ladies. Melania faced several challenges in 2018, includingallegations of extramarital affairsby her husband, surgery forkidney disease, and a tour of Africa that was overshadowed by scandals. During her tenure as first lady, Melania prioritized children\\'s issues, launching theBe Bestcampaign to promote children\\'s welfare and making many visits to children\\'s hospitals. She opposed her husband\\'sfamily separation policyand convinced him to end the practice. She was a close advisor to her husband. In the final months of her tenure, Melania endorsed her husband\\'sfalse claims of election fraudin the2020 presidential election, and has largely stayed out of public view since leaving the White House.Early life and educationMelanija Knavs was born inNovo Mesto, Yugoslavia, now part of present-daySlovenia, on April 26, 1970.[4][5]Her father Viktor Knavs first worked as a chauffeur, and he eventually sold car parts for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer as he made connections with theLeague of Communists of Yugoslavia, the national communist party.[6]Her motherAmalijaworked as apatternmakerat the children\\'s clothing manufacturer Jutranjka inSevnica.[4][7]In Sevnica, the family lived in the state-run housing complex Naselje Heroja Maroka.[8]She has an older sister, Ines,[9]and an older half-brother from her father\\'s previous relationship, Denis Cigelnjak, whom she reportedly has never met.[10]Her father denied paternity of the boy, even after it was confirmed by apaternity test.[11]Although Melanija\\'s father was a member of Yugoslavia\\'s communist party, which espoused a policy ofstate atheism,[12]he had his daughters secretlybaptizedasCatholic, as was common.[13][14]The family was well-off relative to most who lived in communist societies. They frequently went on vacations to other parts of Europe.[11]Their apartment was decorated with brightly colored walls, which was a major departure from other apartments in the country.[11][10]As a child, Melanija, like other children of workers at the factory participated in fashion shows that featured children\\'s clothing.[15][7][16]Textiles were Sevnica\\'s primary industry. Students were excused from school to participate in the shows.[17]From a young age, Melanija expressed an interest in fashion, and she began customizing and sewing her own clothes.[8]She developed a skill for it by watching her mother work.[18]Melanija did well in school, where she was appointed school treasurer.[19]When Melanija was a teenager, she moved to a two-story house in Sevnica with her family.[20]From her youth in Slovenia, Melanija was influenced by the United States: she described thepresidency of Ronald Reaganas the beginning of a new era in her own country and the debut ofCNN Internationalin 1985 gave her family access to American media.[21]Of particular interest to Melanija was the new exposure to global fashion.[18]At the age of fifteen, she began attending the Secondary School for Design and Photography inLjubljana, making the long commute from her hometown to the capital and back each day by train. After her first year, she and Ines moved to the capital together in an apartment paid for by their father.[22]After graduating at age nineteen, Melanija enrolled in the Faculty of Architecture and Civil and Geodetic Engineering at theUniversity of Ljubljanato further study design, leaving after a few months without finishing her degree.[23][24]Early modeling careerEuropean careerMelania was discovered by Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko when she was sixteen, after modeling in a school-sponsored show.[25][26]At the time, she had wanted to be a fashion designer rather than a model.[11]Melania won a modeling contest with the Italian studioCinecittàthat entitled her to a movie role, but she rejected the prize after a producer sexually propositioned her.[27]As her modeling career progressed, Melania took on an alternate spelling of her name, Melania Knauss. She traveled Europe to find modeling work.[23][28]Except a few close relatives, she did not maintain contact with anyone she knew in Slovenia.[29]In 1992, Melania was namedrunner-upin theJana MagazineLook of the Yearcontest, which promised its top three contestants an international modeling contract.[4][23][11]She signed with RVR Reclame in Milan, but she left the organization a few months later.[30]Melania spent the following years traveling Europe for modeling jobs, including one in which she portrayed the first female president of the United States in 1993.[31]Around age 23 or 24, she made Paris her primary residence, where she lived with her roommateVictoria Silvstedt.[32]Melania modeled for fashion houses in Paris and Milan, where in 1995 she met Metropolitan Models co-ownerPaolo Zampolli, who was on a scouting trip in Europe. Zampolli, a friend of her future husbandDonald Trump,[16]became one of the few people who was involved in Melania\\'s life for a long time.[33]Relocating to New YorkZampolli urged Melania to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her.[16]In 1996, Melania moved to Manhattan.[16][11]By this time, she was already 26 years old, much older than most aspiring models.[34]Zampolli encouraged Melania to live near and socialize with people in the fashion industry,[35]and he arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian inZeckendorf TowersinUnion Square.[36][16]Her rent was taken from her pay with Zampolli\\'s agency.[37]Once she resided in the United States, she returned to her home country only sparingly and only for short periods of time.[38]She lived a healthy lifestyle, managing her diet carefully,[39]and she avoided the drinking and partying that often consumed the lives of the models around her.[40]She did not lead an active social life and only went out on rare occasions.[40][39]Melania was featured in a sexually explicit photo shoot for a 1997 issue ofMax, a French men\\'s magazine, with another female model. The photos were shot by the photographer Alexandre Ale de Basseville, and the work was unpaid, instead promising Melania exposure in a prominent magazine. The photos were largely forgotten until they were published by theNew York Postin 2016.[41]For her first weeks in the United States, hertravel visadid not allow her to work in the country. Despite this, she accepted ten modeling jobs that earned her approximately $20,000 (equivalent to $39,000 in 2023). She then received anH-1B visathat allowed her to work.[35]She received her first major job when she posed for aCamel cigarettead shot byEllen von Unwerth, which was displayed as aTimes Squarebillboard and ran inRolling Stone. The opportunity came about from a law that required cigarette ads only feature individuals above the age of 25, which excluded most aspiring models.[42]When her roommate Atanian left New York, Melania moved to an apartment off ofPark Avenue.[43]Marriage and familyMeeting Donald TrumpDonald Trump and Melania Knauss in 1999In September 1998, Zampolli introduced Melania to the real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party.[44]Donald had a date to the event,Celina Midelfart. When he asked Melania for her phone number, she refused. Instead, she insisted that he give her his own number. He passed her test when he gave her multiple personal numbers instead of an office number.[45][46]She later said that giving her own number would make her \"just one of the women he calls\".[45]The exact details of when and where this took place are unclear, though the Kit Kat Club is often described as where they met.[47]After a week, Melania called Donald and they went on a date.[48]She intentionally gave him an indifferent attitude to his advances, knowing this would pique his interest.[49]Not only was Donald\\'s personality similar to that of Melania\\'s father,[15][50][51]but they were of similar ages and had similar physical appearances.[11][50][52]When they began dating, Melania had access to his bookTrump: The Art of the Comeback, in which he detailed what he wanted from a relationship.[53][54]Melania held a press conference on September 8, spending the event recounting her successes and telling reporters that she was \"world famous\", \"among the top 50\" highest paid models in the world, and set to appear in a movie alongsideMickey Rourke.[55]The intention was to build her profile in anticipation of another, ultimately unsuccessful, cigarette ad campaign.[56]This was unusual behavior for a woman who typically kept a quiet and professional presence,[57]and reporters were unable to verify the claims she made.[58]The Trumps have stated that they met at theNew York Fashion Weekshortly after this conference, but according to biographerMary Jordan, rumors in the industry suggested that their relationship had already developed by then.[57]Their relationship initially only lasted a few weeks. Melania left Donald after she saw his ex-girlfriendKara YoungleavingTrump Tower, but she reunited with him the following week.[59]Relationship with Donald TrumpDonald\\'s fame and connections gave her new career opportunities.[60]Shortly after the death ofJacqueline Kennedy, whom Melania and her mother had deeply admired, Melania met theKennedy familyat a gala.[61]She continued to encounter celebrities while attending events with Donald.[62]Melania continued her modeling career after meeting Donald,[16]though she took fewer jobs as time went on and she dedicated more time to him.[63]In 1999, the couple gained attention after an interview withshock jockHoward Sternon his show, in which he asked them lewd sexual questions.[64]Donald often brought Melania to meetings to show her off, praising her beauty. He did not let her participate in the business, citing the conflict he had with his first wife after giving her an executive role.[65]Melania Knauss withKylie Bax, Donald Trump, and then-presidentBill Clintonin 2000Donald announcedhis candidacyfor theReform Party presidential nominationon October 7, 1999. Melania adamantly supported the move.[66]When asked byThe New York Timeswhat her role would be if Donald were to become president, Melania replied: \"I would be very traditional, likeBetty Fordor Jackie Kennedy.\"[67]Melania saw extensive media attention astabloidsconsidered the idea of a model as first lady.[68]Melania was one of the first models recruited to Donald\\'s modeling agency,Trump Model Management, after its creation in February 1999. The following months, she appeared in several magazines and advertisements organized by individuals close to Donald.[69]While Donald was organizing his campaign, Melania appeared in the February edition ofSports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. The image featured her in a bikini alongside a large inflatable whale, and the shoot was run byAntoine Verglas, an associate of Zampolli\\'s.[70]Shortly after the shoot, Verglas called Melania back for another project where he had her pose nude in aBond girlaesthetic.[71]Melania later said that she stood \\'proudly behind [her] nude modeling work\\' in a post on X in September of 2024.[72]Donald had lobbied for her inclusion in aGQspread,[73]and her relationship with Donald allowed the shoot access to hisBoeing 727. Images from the shoot were featured in the January 2000 edition ofGQmagazine.[71]At the time, Donald\\'s involvement was not made known.[35]She then appeared in another sexualized photo shoot where she was posted in a mock-up of theOval Office.[74]In January 2000, news broke that Melania and Donald had broken up, with conflicting accounts of who ended the relationship. Many photos and publicity pieces the two had done together were quickly edited before publication to accommodate the change.[75]They kept in contact, and they reunited a few months later.[76]Melania received hergreen cardin 2001, granting herpermanent residencyin the United States.[35][4]Melania and Donald moved in together at Trump Tower in 2002.[77]She made her first appearance on Donald\\'s game showThe Apprenticein April 2004 when an episode had the contestants visit their penthouse.[78]Engagement and weddingDonald proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, on her birthday as they were leaving to attend theMet Gala.[79]He reasoned that he was more willing to wed as she had not insisted on marriage, and he felt she was an influence in the success he had seen over the previous years.[80]She also signed hisprenuptial agreementwithout issue.[81]A few months before the wedding, Melania traveled to Paris withAnna WintourandAndré Leon Talleyto find a wedding dress, and Melania decided on a dress byJohn Galliano.[82]In the days leading up to the wedding, she appeared on the front cover ofVoguein her dress.[83][84]Donald and Melania married on January 22, 2005, at theBethesda-by-the-Seachurch inPalm Beach, Florida.[85]The ceremony was followed by a reception in theballroomat Donald\\'sMar-a-Lagoestate, which Melania planned with Preston Bailey.[86]Numerous celebrities were present, including musicians, athletes, media executives, and television personalities.[87]She had onebridesmaid, her sister Ines, who had moved to New York so they could be closer together.[38]Melania arranged all of the details of the wedding with her planner. She let Donald make decisions about the event, but she refused his suggestion that the wedding be broadcast onNBC.[88]Marriage and motherhoodDonald Trump and Melania Trump in 2006The Trumps hadthree residencesthat they traveled between: Trump Tower in New York,Trump National Golf Club Bedminsterin New Jersey, and Mar-a-Lago in Florida.[38][89]To have her own private abode, Melania had a private spa constructed on the top floor of Trump Tower.[89]As a couple, the two did not spend much direct time together, preferring to live adjacently with one another.[90]According to Donald, their passive relationship suited him because he worked for a living and did not \"want to go home and work at a relationship\".[11][91]Melania accepted a transaction element in their relationship, though she cared about Donald and did not believe that she was agold digger.[92]When she attended events with her husband at Trump facilities, she often stayed for only a few minutes to make an appearance before returning to the private residence.[93]Donald did not learn to speak Melania\\'s native language, which she said she accepted because she is \"not a nagging wife\".[4]Upon marrying Donald, Melania became stepmother to his four children:Donald Trump Jr.,Eric TrumpandIvanka Trumpfrom his first marriage toIvana Zelníčková, andTiffany Trumpfrom his second marriage toMarla Maples.[94]Melania had especially bonded with Tiffany, who was six when Melania began dating Tiffany\\'s father, and made sure she felt included among her step-siblings.[95]When Melania herself became pregnant, it was widely covered in the media.[96]This included her second appearance on the cover ofVogue, featuring her pregnant body in a bikini and an open coat.[97]Melania spent the months with her sister and her parents, who visited throughout the pregnancy. She also oversaw the construction of a nursery in Trump Tower.[98]She had ababy showerat theFAO Schwarztoy store, but she insisted that the toys and gifts she received be donated to a children\\'s hospital.[99]On March 20, 2006, Melania and Donald had a son,Barron William Trump.[100]Melania chose her son\\'s middle name, while Donald chose his first name.[101]Donald had previously used the name Barron as apseudonymfor when he posed as his own public relations agent.[102]After Barron was born, Melania was active in his life and accordingly spent less time attending events with her husband.[103][104]Donald had made it clear to her that if they had a child, he would not be actively involved in the child\\'s life.[104]Melania later said she approved of this, stating that she \"didn\\'t want him changing diapers or putting Barron to bed\".[11]She avoided the use of nannies, with a few exceptions in Barron\\'s earliest years, insisting on raising him herself.[105]This lessened social activity meant that Donald began courting supermodels again, which made Melania uncomfortable. According to biographer Mary Jordan, Melania did not know about the women who later alleged that they had extramarital affairs with him.[89]Melania stayed out of the public spotlight after she settled into her life as a Trump, excepting occasional charity work and an appearance in anAflaccommercial.[106]She became a citizen of the United States on July 28, 2006.[107]She then sponsored her parents using the \"chain migration\" immigration process that her husband later repeatedly criticized.[108][109]Melania and Barron maintaindual citizenship, both in the United States and Slovenia[110]Spending most of her time at Trump residences, she rarely kept companions besides her parents and her son.[93]Business venturesAs her son reached childhood, Melania found herself with more time for other pursuits.[111]She trademarked her name, Melania, in 2009 as a jewelry brand, which she used to sell less expensive jewelry pieces onQVC.[112]She was intentional about not using the Trump name in her branding, correcting reporters who called it Melania Trump.[113]She drew the designs herself,[11]which were based on three places where she had lived: New York, Palm Beach, and Paris. Over the following years, she released additionalMelaniacollections, and they sold out each time.[113]Melania Trump in 2011Melania then developed a line ofcaviar-infused skincare products under the brand Melania Marks Skincare in 2011.[114]The brand never launched. It brought about a legal case when the company selling the products, New Sunshine, underwent management changes and voided the contract. The company alleged that one executive had given asweetheart dealto the Trumps because he was a family friend. The case was decided in Melania\\'s favor, and the amount to be paid to her was settled out of court.[115]She had initially sued the company for $50 million in lost revenue.[116]Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaignPersonal life during the campaignMelania was the one who finally convinced Donaldto campaign for presidentin the2016 presidential election, telling him that he either needed to do it or stop talking about it.[117][118]When the campaign began, Melania made it clear to her husband that she would not be pressured into campaigning or attending events, and that she would only make appearances when she wanted to. She subsequently played a relatively small role in the campaign, which had been atypical of spouses of presidential candidates since the early 20th century.[119]Explaining her absence, she cited the need to stay home with her son Barron.[120][121]Her daily routine was nonetheless altered by the campaign, as she had to take security arrangements into account when she traveled, and she could not post about her activities online in real time.[122]Once a prolific user ofInstagramandTwitter, she became less active on her social media accounts when the campaign began.[11]While many people doubted Donald\\'s chances at the presidency, including his own inner circle, Melania believed he would win.[123][124]Unlike Donald\\'s advisors, Melania encouraged him to follow his instincts and say what he felt he should say, with the exception that she does not like his use of profane language.[125]She analyzed the campaign closely from home, following polling and watching how her husband interacted with his opponents.[126]She spoke to him on the phone regularly throughout the campaign, including a conversation after each rally in which she gave a candid evaluation of how he did.[127]Campaign involvementMelania Trump at a campaign event with Donald and Barron in November 2015Melania\\'s career as a model was an advantage during the campaign, as she was prepared for photographers and did not need to hire a fashion consultant.[23]As a model, she was required to be deliberate in all of her movement, including how she stood and walked.[128]She resented being called shy during the campaign, saying that this was an impression spread by people who only briefly met her and wanted their \"15 minutes of fame\".[129]Melania\\'s earliest speaking appearances in November 2015 and February 2016 were prompted by Donald calling on her to speak to the crowd. Both times, she only said a few sentences.[130]Her first scheduled speech during the campaign did not take place until April 2016.[121]The campaign reportedly wanted to get Melania more active, as she was in a unique position to humanize Donald and to appeal to theAmerican Dreamfrom an immigrant\\'s perspective.[131]Hope Hickswas the campaign\\'s main liaison with Melania, facilitating any appearances that she wished to make. Melania trusted Hicks\\'s judgement and allowed her to weigh the importance of a given appearance.[132]Her rare appearances brought her toswing stateswhere her husband needed extra support, and her speeches celebrated his personal traits instead of policy.[120]Melania was involved in thevice presidential selection process, meeting with the top contenders, and her approval ofMike Pencecontributed to his selection. The deciding factor, in her mind, was that Pence was not as ambitious as the other contenders and would not seek to undermine Donald.[133]Media coverageMelania Trump in 2016Anattack adagainst the Trumps was produced by asuper PACthat supported Donald\\'s opponentTed Cruzfeaturing Melania\\'s nudeGQphoto with the caption \"Meet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday\", intensifying the rivalry between the two candidates in the2016 Republican Party presidential primaries.[120][134][11]More nude images of Melania were published on the front page of theNew York Postin July 2016 in a story titled \"The Ogle Office\". The images did not have a major effect on the campaign, as Melania was seen as the victim, but they were humiliating and she spent the following two months away from the public.[135]On July 18, 2016, Melania gavea speechat the2016 Republican National Convention. A controversy emerged after it became apparent that a paragraph of the speech had been plagiarized fromMichelle Obama\\'s speech at the2008 Democratic National Convention.[136][137]When asked about it, Melania said she wrote the speech herself \"with as little help as possible\".[138]Despite political campaigns typically having several people to scrutinize such speeches, no one in the Trump campaign had reviewed the speech.[139]Donald was furious with his staff and felt he had failed Melania, while Melania felt she herself had failed the campaign through the scandal.[140]It was the only major speech she delivered during the campaign.[141]Two days later, Trump staff writerMeredith McIvertook responsibility, saying there was a misunderstanding when Melania read passages of Obama\\'s speech as examples.[136][142]The speech also included a rare statement on her past, describing her family in Slovenia and her early modeling career.[139]After giving the speech, Melania stayed out of public view until election day approached.[143]Access HollywoodtapeOn October 7, a month before the election, theAccess Hollywoodtapewas leaked. The tape had been recorded in 2005, shortly after their marriage, and it featured audio of Donald making controversial remarks about his treatment of women. Immediately after its release, the campaign\\'s primary concern was Melania\\'s reaction. It took Donald two hours before he went to see Melania. Upon their meeting, Melania reportedly told him \"Now you could lose, you could have blown this for us\", and then left the room after he apologized.[144]In 2024, her husband\\'s former personal counselMichael Cohentestified duringThe People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trumptrial that Donald had privately credited her as having suggested that the campaign\\'s response strategy should best characterize the conversation on the tape as\"locker room talk\".[145]Melania kept her distance from him, angry that he may have ended his candidacy with his comments, and she waited a day before making a comment.[146]When asked by the campaign to make a scripted appearance alongside Donald as damage control, she refused, deciding that she was going to respond her own way.[147]She also refused to sit beside him during his recorded apology as politicians\\' spouses often did in these situations.[148]Melania released a statement saying that the tape did not show \"the man I know\" and said those whoaccused him of sexual misconductare liars.[136]Melania received significantly more attention from the press following the incident,[149]and she was frustrated by the pity she received.[147]A few days later, she attended apresidential debatewearing apussy bow, causing widespread speculation about her intention (as her husband\\'s comments on the Access Hollywood tape had included, \"grab them by thepussy\"–with pussy beingslangforvagina).[150][149]After she voted, Melania spent most of election day with her parents in Trump Tower while the rest of the family did last minute campaigning.[151]First lady of the United States (2017–2021)First lady in ManhattanMelania Trump with Donald Trump at the Liberty Ball, January 20, 2017AfterDonald\\'s inaugurationas president on January 20, 2017,[152]Melania announced that she would not move toWashington, D.C.with him, instead staying in Manhattan so Barron could finish the school year there.[153]This also allowed her to introduce her son to theWhite Housegradually so as not to overwhelm him.[154]During this time, Melania negotiated new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald to reflect the changes in their lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron received a suitable inheritance.[155]Melania was the second foreign-born woman to hold the title of first lady afterLouisa Adams, who was born in England,[152]and Melania was the firstnaturalized citizento hold the title.[156]She has said that she can speak English, Italian, French, and German in addition to her native Slovene, but in public she has only spoken English and Slovene.[157]She was also the secondCatholicfirst lady of the United States, after Jacqueline Kennedy.[158][159]Melania\\'s absence from the White House caused speculation that her stepdaughter Ivanka would serve as an acting first lady.[153][160][161]As time went by, members of the administration\\'s staff like her assistant,Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, grew unhappy with Melania\\'s absence, as it gave the impression of marital issues and prevented her from exercising a calming influence over the president.[162][163]She also stoked resentment among many of the people in New York, who predominantly opposed the Trumps, because of the costs and traffic issues caused by theSecret Servicepresence.[164][165]The Secret Service itself also faced logistical issues from the repeated travel to New York. Having a Secret Service detail was not a major adjustment for Melania though, as she had spent years around her husband\\'s security team.[166]She was given theSecret Service code name\"Muse\" to go along with the president\\'s name \"Mogul\".[167]Being first lady came with another drawback for Melania, as she was expected to speak on serious topics such as immigration policy and had little control over how her media appearances were handled, which was a different experience than she had as a model.[168]Melania Trump with Pope Francis, the Vatican, May 2017When the Trump administration\\'sWhite House websitewas posted, Melania\\'s biographical information caused controversy because it listed her jewelry business. Though it had already ceased operation, critics alleged that it was an attempt to promote her business with government resources.[169]Another allegation of attempting to profit from her role as first lady came up in February, when she sued theDaily Mailfor libel after it alleged in 2016 that she had worked for anescort agency.[170]The suit was initially for lost career opportunities, but this was changed to emotional distress when she received questions about why she expected to have career opportunities as first lady.[171]On March 8, 2017, Melania hosted her first White House event, a luncheon forInternational Women\\'s Day. She spoke to an audience of women about her life as a female immigrant and about working towardsgender equalityboth domestically and abroad, noting the role of education as a tool againstgender inequality.[172][173]The Trumps visitedVatican Cityin May 2017. As Melania was visiting as a Catholic,Pope Francisblessed her rosary beads, and she placed flowers at the feet of a statue of theMadonnaat the Vatican\\'sBambino Gesùchildren\\'s hospital.[174]The first major public attention Melania received was after an incident in May 2017 while the Trumps were visiting Israel. Donald had forgotten that Melania was by his side when he was walking with Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu, and she fell behind from the group. Humiliated, she slapped away his hand when he reached out behind him to grab hers. This was the first time press coverage of Melania took notice of an independent streak.[175][176]East Wing staffThe lack of staff appointments in theEast Wingduring the first months of the Trump administration—typically the domain of the first lady—caused a backlog of tour requests to develop. In February several hires were made for theOffice of the First Lady:Anna Cristina Niceta Lloydas social secretary,Lindsay Reynoldsas the first lady\\'s chief of staff, Tham Kannalikham as her decorator, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff as the first lady\\'s assistant, andStephanie Grishamas communications director.[177]Melania retained the head florist appointed by Michelle Obama, Hedieh Ghaffarian.[178]Thechief usherappointed under theObama administration,Angella Reid, was replaced byTrump International HotelemployeeTimothy Harleth, breaking the norm of the chief usher serving under multiple presidencies.[177]Reid had been broadly unpopular with the staff, and the firing earned Melania their goodwill.[179]The first lady\\'s staff remained small relative to those of her predecessors.[177]This was in part because she did not want to have any employees speaking on her behalf. Instead, she answered her correspondences herself.[180]Melania had a reputation in the White House for being \"drama-free\",[181]and for treating the staff well.[182]According to her husband\\'s campaign managerCorey Lewandowski, her staff had \"100 percent loyalty to her\".[183]Melania had a close, trusting relationship with her staff, and she was protective of them when conflict arose.[184]Before moving in, Melania worked with Kannalikham to redecorate the White House, as first ladies typically do. She had most of the Obama-era decor replaced, and like the Obamas, the Trumps paid for it out of pocket instead of using the allotted funding.[185]Life in the White HouseMelania Trump with Argentine first ladyJuliana Awadain 2017Melania and her son, Barron, moved into the White House on June 11, 2017.[186]Like they had throughout their marriage, Melania and Donald chose to sleep in separate bedrooms.[187]In her first year, Melania gave only eight speeches, compared to 74 by Michelle Obama and 42 byLaura Bush.[188]Instead of frequent public appearances, she communicated her activities through video.[183]Most of Melania\\'s appearances as first lady in 2017 were in Manhattan and Washington, and she typically spoke about women\\'s and children\\'s issues.[189]After moving to the White House, Melania opted to spend most of her time in the private quarters, running the White House staff from there instead of the first lady\\'s East Wing offices. She oversaw restorations of several rooms in the building, including the bowling alley in theWhite House basementand the first lady\\'s hairdresser\\'s room.[190]She kept one office, called the \"swag room\" by aides, in which she kept trinkets she collected while she was first lady.[191]To accommodate Barron\\'s soccer practice, she had a net installed on the White House grounds and had a coach practice with him.[192]Barron remained Melania\\'s top priority when she was first lady, and she worked to keep him free from politics to the point that staffers referred to her as \"The Protector\".[193]Even after arriving at the White House, Melania spent extensive time away each year, visiting Mar-a-Lago on major holidays and over many weekends.[194]Melania Trump examining the 2018 White House Christmas decorationsMelania personally involved herself in decorations and planning within the White House.[195]She was particular about how things were designed and arranged whenever events were planned, but she would take on a calm and relaxed demeanor once the event began.[196]Whenever a foreign dignitary arrived at the White House, Melania had theBlue Roomset aside where she ate lunch or drank tea with the dignitary\\'s spouse.[197]When choosing whichpresidential china setto use, Melania often chose theClinton administrationchina with its gold embroidery.[198]She held events less frequently than her predecessors, with a typical week featuring three or fewer events, all under one hour long.[199]Among her most ambitious projects was planning the White House Christmas decorations in 2018. Moving away from traditional designs, she filled the East Collonnade with red cranberry-laden trees set atop a green carpet. The design was widely derided, which Melania ascribed to personal taste.[200]To protect use of her image and maintain an income, Melania licensed photos from her photoshoots throughGetty Images. This allowed her to choose how they were used by reporters, and she received royalties for each use. TheOffice of Government Ethicsreported that she made $100,000 to $1,000,000 in royalties in 2017, though other estimates put it at over $10,000,000.[201]As one of her official duties, Melania was the honorary chair of theJohn F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Because of political tension with the arts communities, she was not initially active in the role. She made her first appearances at the Kennedy Center in 2019.[202]Tribulations in early 2018A scandal broke in January 2018 when it was alleged that Donald hadhad an extramarital affairwith the pornographic actressStormy Daniels. The affair was said to have taken place in July 2006, after the Trumps\\' marriage and the birth of their son. Melania\\'s public appearances became more infrequent after the news emerged, and she canceled several events that she was to attend with her husband.[203]This included the2018 State of the Union Address, where Melania made the unprecedented decision to ride separately from him on the way there.[204]Michael Cohen, who had arranged the silencing of the alleged affair, stated that his greatest regret was lying to Melania, saying that she didn\\'t deserve it.[205]The next month, the story of a second affair in 2006 with the modelKaren McDougalwas made public.[203][206]To Melania, the worst part was that she felt Donald had publicly humiliated her.[207][163]Left to right:Brigitte Macron, Melania Trump,Emmanuel Macron,Donald TrumpMelania learned in April 2018 that she was afflicted with kidney disease, but she only told her parents, her husband, and her sister.[208]On May 14, she began treatment atWalter Reed National Military Medical Center.[209]While her husband had wished to join her, his presence would have risked the press discovering her condition.[210]The official statement said that she underwent anembolization, aminimally invasive procedurethat deliberately blocks a blood vessel.[211][211]A statement was released after the procedure was finished without complication,[209]and she recovered in the hospital over the following five days.[212]The extended stay led to false rumors and conspiracy theories that she had gottenplastic surgery.[213][214]After leaving the hospital, she continued to stay out of the public eye until the beginning of June.[215]At this point, the president let slip that the surgery had been more serious than initially suggested.[216]Those around Melania noticed that she was generally happier by mid-2018. By this time, she had reached a more advantageous marital agreement that ensured Barron would be given a fair inheritance.[217]Her public position, and the corresponding influence she had over her husband\\'s political career, had given her the advantage in negotiations.[218]After several months of problems, Melania received positive coverage for a large custom-made white hat that she wore during a visit by French presidentEmmanuel Macron.[219]On August 9, 2018, Melania\\'s parents were granted American citizenship. This revitalized accusations of hypocrisy by the Trumps regarding Melania\\'s parents, as Donald had spoken out against the chain migration process that allowed them to enter the United States.[220]2018 Africa tourMelania Trump wearing apith helmetin KenyaIn October 2018, Melania took a tour of Africa without Donald, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt. She spent much of her time with children in schools, orphanages, and hospitals. She used the trip to tout relief work being carried out by theUnited States Agency for International Development, which raised questions about her husband\\'s intention to cut its funding. Melania also received criticism for her fashion choices, where a photo opportunity in front of theGreat Sphinx of Gizawas seen as exploitive and apith helmetshe wore in Kenya was criticized for its association withcolonialism in Africa. To these criticisms, she responded that people should pay more attention to her actions instead of her outfits.[221]Perception of the trip grew worse when she responded to criticisms by saying that she was \"the most bullied person in the world\".[222]Throughout Melania\\'s tour of Africa, personality conflicts took place between her team andMira Ricardel, theDeputy National Security Advisor.[223]Ricardel\\'s staffer had been bumped from the first lady\\'s plane on the flight to Africa to make room for a journalist, and Ricardel subsequently became less cooperative with providing logistical information needed for the tour.[224]Upon returning, Ricardel gave a thoroughly negative report on Melania\\'s staff, describing them as embarrassing the White House with their partying.[225]Melania twice complained to the president, but no immediate action was taken.[225]So the following month, the Office of the First Lady issued an official statement calling for Ricardel to be removed from her position. Publicly commenting on such a thing was unprecedented for a first lady.[226]No one in the administration had been told in advance about the statement, including the president.[225]Ricardel was fired the following day.[227]A dispute over the trip arose between Melania and Ivanka a few months later when the latter made her own trip to the continent. Melania felt that in taking such a similar trip, Ivanka was intruding on the first lady\\'s role.[228]Political influenceMelania Trump working with children at a 2017 Christmas event; children\\'s welfare was among the most important issues to Melania.Melania was the one person exempt from the criticism and distrust that Donald leveled against those around him in the White House. He held her opinion in high regard, often agreeing with her when she made it known, and he valued her loyalty as she did not seek public attention of her own.[229]Melania believed that it was not her duty as first lady to take policy positions in her own right, but simply to advise Donald regarding his.[11]She was the only person among those around him who could critique him directly without repercussion.[230]Donald frequently asked for her opinion about issues he was considering or people who he interacted with, calling her over the phone when she was not in the same room.[231]Melania paid close attention to media coverage throughout Donald\\'s presidency, providing her input on what would make good optics and maintain his image.[232][233]She also provided advice on how to pose for pictures and has given him suggestions on how to appear when moving.[234]The nature of their relationship allowed Melania to overlook erratic behavior from Donald, as she had long believed that there was no use in trying to change someone\\'s personality, especially her husband\\'s.[180]Melania had influence over her husband\\'s staff, and Donald sometimes fired individuals on her advice.[186][235]The welfare of children is a subject of interest for her, and she routinely made visits to children\\'s hospitals throughout her tenure as first lady.[236]According to her biographer Kate Bennett, interacting with children is one of the rare things that causes Melania to shift away from her usual stoic demeanor.[237]Her advocacy was a major factor in her husband\\'s decision to ban fruit flavoredelectronic cigarettes.[238]About one year into her tenure, Melania hired Reagan Thompson as a policy advisor, though she had yet to adopt any official initiatives at the time.[239]Family separation policyMelania was openly critical of her husband\\'s\"zero tolerance\" policy of denying asylumat theMexico–United States borderin 2018, where children were being separated from their parents. Her official position was that she hated to see families separated and hoped for successful immigration reform.[240][241]Out of public view, she made her opposition clear to the president and influenced his decision to end it.[242]Leaked tapes in 2020 featured Melania making statements defending some of the practices, expressing grief about family separation but questioning the validity ofasylum claimsand dismissing concerns that children were kept in substandard conditions.[243]Melania was upset when her stepdaughter Ivanka began receiving the credit for changing the president\\'s mind on the issue.[244]Melania decided to visit the border herself, ignoring her husband\\'s worries about keeping media attention on the border and the Secret Service\\'s need of advance notice to plan her trip.[245]She arrived at the border on June 21, where she visited the family separation facilities in Texas and attended aroundtablewith doctors, medical staff, social workers, and other experts at Upbring New Hope Children\\'s Shelter.[246]On the way to the border facility, she caused controversy by wearing a jacket that read, \"I really don\\'t care, do u?\" After much speculation about the jacket\\'s message, including criticism that she may have been expressing indifference toward the families separated at the border, Melania stated that the jacket was aimed at people and media who were criticizing her.[247]The jacket dominated media coverage of her visit.[248]Be Best campaignMain article:Be BestMelania Trump celebrating the second anniversary of the Be Best campaignOn May 7, 2018, Melania held a press conference in theWhite House Rose Gardento announce her official public initiative as first lady, the Be Best awareness campaign. The initiative was created to support the welfare of children, advocate againstcyberbullying, and preventopioid abuse.[212][249]The initiative\\'s name drew ridicule in the press for its grammatical structure.[250]Instead of creating new programs like previous first ladies\\' projects, Be Best promoted existing initiatives and organizations that worked toward the cause. Public awareness of the initiative remained low, and it was often regarded solely as an anti-cyberbullying campaign.[251]The Be Best campaign drew criticism for its perceived hypocrisy, challenging cyberbullying when her husband was well known for attacking people online.[252][251]Even Donald had warned her before the campaign\\'s launch that the contrast may provoke criticism.[251]She acknowledged the discrepancy but insisted that she would continue because she felt it was a good cause.[252]This received more attention in 2019 when the president made Twitter posts critical ofGreta Thunberg, a teenage environmental activist diagnosed on theautism spectrum. This came days after Melania had criticizedPamela Karlanfor invoking Barron in a speech against the president. The first lady\\'s office responded that spouses can have different communication styles, and said that Barron was not \"an activist who travels the globe giving speeches\".[253]COVID-19 and 2020 presidential campaignMelania Trump with first responders during theCOVID-19 pandemicMelania carried out a major reorganization of her staff in April 2020 in anticipation ofher husband\\'s reelection campaign. She appointed Marcia Lee Kelly as her senior advisor andEmma Doyleas her policy advisor. Melania\\'s chief of staff, Lindsay Reynolds, was removed; her responsibilities went to Melania\\'s communications director, Stephanie Grisham.[183]Melania became an active campaigner for her husband during the2020 presidential election, which was a strong contrast to her 2016 activity.[254]When theCOVID-19 pandemicbegan, Melania was criticized for promoting a White House renovation project. She took the topic more seriously after theCOVID-19 lockdownsbegan, using her Twitter account to encouragesocial distancing during the pandemicand promote official medical advice. Much of what she posted directly contradicted what her husband posted, as he discouraged many of the recommended practices.[255][256]On October 1, 2020, Melania\\'s former advisor Stephanie Winston Wolkoff released audiotapes that featured Melania making profane statements about her image and role as first lady. In the tapes, she condemned the media for not giving her positive coverage, questioned why people wanted her to speak out against her husband when she supported his policies, and expressed frustration with her responsibility to oversee Christmas decorations in the White House. She also mentioned her \"I really don\\'t care, do u\" jacket in the tapes, admitting that she wore it to irritateliberals. Winston Wolkoff had released the tapes alongside atell-allbook,Melania and Me.[243][257]The Justice Department filed acivil suitagainst Winston Wolkoff in October 2019, alleging breach of anondisclosure agreement, but it was dropped in February 2021 under the Biden administration.[258]In September 2022, Melania said in an interview withBreitbart Newsthat the audiotapes had been strategically edited to make people believe that her duties in the White House had been unimportant to her.[259]Despite Donald\\'s loss of the 2020 election,[260]Melania ended her tenure by endorsing his false statement that he had been the legitimate election winner.[191][222]For her final months in the White House, she stopped visiting her office in the East Wing and remained in the White House residence. Her focus at this time was on compiling photo albums of the decorations and renovations she had overseen through her tenure.[191]Melania was managing photography at the White House when theJanuary 6 United States Capitol attacktook place and gave no comment at the time. She later said that she would have commented if she had been \"fully informed of all the details\".[163]Her communications director Stephanie Grisham later stated she had sent Melania a text message asking her to make a statement condemning the violence and resigned when that did not happen.[191]On January 18, Melania released a farewell video asking the American people to uphold the principles of her Be Best campaign.[222]She did not contact incoming first ladyJill Bidento make transition arrangements or provide her the traditional tour of the White House.[222]She did, however, follow the tradition of leaving a letter for the incoming first lady.[191]As her husband, Donald Trump, was elected to the presidency for a second, non-consecutive term on November 5, 2024, Trump will return to her role as First Lady in January 2025.[261]After the White House (2021–present)After the Trumps left the White House, Melania returned to Mar-a-Lago, where she could live while avoiding public attention.[163]She retained one White House advisor, Marcia Lee Kelly, to help her during the post-presidency.[222]Melania kept in contact with her successor Jill Biden, and the two have exchanged birthday cards.[191]Since her tenure as first lady ended, Melania has made occasional paid speaking appearances, she has founded a scholarship program forfoster children, and she has minted a line ofApollo 11–themednon-fungible tokensthat were not in compliance withNASA\\'s image use policy.[163]In November 2023, Melania attended the memorial service for former First LadyRosalynn Carter.[262]Melania remained out of public view during her husband\\'scourt appearancesandhis candidacyin the2024 presidential election, limiting her campaign events to two fundraisers for theLog Cabin Republicans. She became more visible in July 2024 by putting out a statement following theattempted assassination of her husbandand appearing at the2024 Republican National Convention, though she declined an invitation to speak at the event, making her the first candidate\\'s spouse not to speak at the convention sinceBarbara Bushbegan the tradition.[263]In the same month, Melania announced her intention to publish amemoir, titledMelania.[264]She caused controversy among Republicans in the lead up to the book\\'s publication when she announced her support for theright to abortion.[265]Donald was reelected president in November 2024. Uponhis second inauguration, Melania will become the second first lady to hold the position two times non-consecutively, afterFrances Cleveland.[266]Public imageMain article:Public image of Melania TrumpA2017 Women\\'s Marchprotester with a Free Melania signMelania limits her interactions with the public, creating a public image heavily influenced by speculation.[267]She worked to protect her privacy as first lady,[268]and her staff was instructed not to answer any questions about her whereabouts at a given time.[181]With limited information, commentators have portrayed her as being a reluctant companion to her husband or as a woman who has no independence of her own. Several incidents during her husband\\'s presidency led to rumors that she had a secret animosity toward her husband, such as her delay in moving to the White House and allegations that he had committed adultery.[213][268][269]The rumors led to popular use of thehashtag#FreeMelania by those who believed them.[270]Though she disliked the idea that people saw her as helpless, Melania found the campaign amusing.[271]This became less common by 2020 as she had become more publicly associated with the role of first lady.[272]She is often seen as cold by the public, though people who interact with her describe her as a warm presence.[4][273]As with previous first ladies, Melania\\'s fashion was heavily scrutinized, and particularly expensive pieces were criticized.[189]More than other first ladies, her fashion was scrutinized in the context of her past as a fashion model and her marriage to a billionaire.[274]She did her own clothes shopping,[275][276]but she was assisted by designerHervé Pierre,[277]hair stylist Mordechai Alvow, and make up artist Nicole Byrl.[278]When preparing for speeches, she dedicated more attention to her physical appearance than content or delivery, which her staff felt affected her ability to promote her causes.[279]Despite her experience in fashion, she disliked that it was such a major aspect of news coverage about her as first lady.[280]Melania has been seen by the American public as the first foreigner first lady. The only other first lady to be born outside of the United States had an American father.[281]Having a Slovenian-born woman as the American first lady became a point of national pride in Slovenia, and it gave the nation a sense of recognition on the world stage.[282][283]Melania\\'s hometown Sevnica has developed a small tourist industry around her, and Melania-themed merchandise was common during her tenure as first lady. These items never used Melania\\'s full name, substituting it with \"first lady\" or \"M\", as she is protective of herpersonality rights.[284]During the 2016 presidential election, Melania became the only candidate\\'s spouse since polling began in 1988 to have a disapproval rating greater than their approval rating.[285]Her approval rating stood at 36 or 37% in the months leading up to becoming first lady in January 2017,[286][153]but it increased to 57% in a CNN poll in April 2018 after she received public sympathy amid allegations that her husband had committed adultery.[239][287]Melania finished her tenure in 2021 as the least popular first lady since polling began with a rating of 42%.[288]Multiple polls during her tenure as first lady showed her as the most popular member of the Trump family.[286][289][290]In December 2020, theSiena College Research Institutereleased a study surveying scholars and historians on their assessments of American first ladies. It was the fifth such first ladies study that the Institute had conducted since 1982, and the first in which Melania appeared. She was ranked as being the worst of 40 assessed American first ladies,[291]receiving the lowest assessments in all of the metrics that were weighed.[292]Footnotes^Pronounced/məˈlɑːniə/mə-LAH-nee-ə^Name prior to her marriage:Melania Knauss(German:[meˈlaːni̯aˈknaʊs]), aGermanizationof her Slovene birth nameMelanija Knavs(Slovene:[mɛˈlaːnijaˈknaːws]).^Frances Clevelandwas the first, serving in the role from 1886 to 1889 and again from 1893 to 1897.Notes^\"Melania Trump votes in N.Y. primary\".The Washington Post.

She lived inCanadain the 1970s, before relocating to the United States and marryingDonald Trumpin 1977. She held key managerial positions inThe Trump Organization, as vice president of interior design, CEO and president of Trump\\'s Castle casino resort, and manager of thePlaza Hotel.Ivana and Donald Trump were prominent figures in New York society throughout the 1980s. The couple\\'s divorce, granted in 1990, was the subject of extensive media coverage.[a]Following the divorce, she developed her own lines of clothing, fashion jewelry, and beauty products which were sold onQVC UKand theHome Shopping Network. She wrote an advice column forGlobecalled \"Ask Ivana\" from 1995 through 2010, and published several books, including works of fiction, self-help, and the autobiographyRaising Trump.Early life and education[edit]Ivana Marie Zelníčková was born on February 20, 1949, in Gottwaldov,Czechoslovakia(nowZlín,Czech Republic), the daughter of Miloš Zelníček and Marie Zelníčková (née Francová).[2][3][4]She was raised in aCatholichousehold.[5]Her father was anelectrical engineerand her mother worked as a telephone operator.[6]Her father encouraged his daughter\\'sskiingabilities, a practice she began at age four.[6][7]After developing skills as a skier, Ivana joined the junior national ski team, which offered her opportunities to travel beyond theSoviet-eracommunist boundaries of what was then theCzechoslovak Socialist Republic.[6]She attendedCharles Universityin Prague and earned a master\\'s degree inphysical educationin 1972.[8][7]In 1970, Ivana appeared onCzechoslovak Televisionin the children\\'s television seriesPan Tau.[9]In 1988, Ivana told journalists that she was selected as an alternate on the Czechoslovak ski team during the1972 Winter Olympics, specializing indownhillandslalom.[10][7]However, Czechoslovakia only sent four female athletes to the 1972 Winter Olympics and none were alpine skiers. In 1989, Petr Pomezný, Secretary General of theCzechoslovak Olympic Committee, denied Ivana\\'s claim and stated that, despite searching extensively, no record could be found of her involvement.[8]In 2021,Snopesconfirmed that Czechoslovakia had not sent female alpine skiers to the 1972 Winter Olympics.[11]Emigration to Canada[edit]In 1971, Ivana married Alfred Winklmayr, anAustrianski instructor and her platonic friend, in order to obtain Austrian citizenship.[12][13][14]The marriage granted her the freedom to leave Czechoslovakia withoutdefectionso she could retain the right to return to visit her parents.[12][15][13][16]As Ivana Winklmayr, she received her Austrian passport in March 1972.[14]The following year, she obtained an absentee divorce from Alfred Winklmayr inLos Angeles,California, where he had moved to teach skiing.[12][15][14]Ivana was romantically involved with the lyricist and playwrightJiří Štaidl[cs]who was killed in a car accident in 1973.[17]After Štaidl\\'s death, Ivana moved to Canada where she lived with George (Jiří) Syrovátka whom she had dated since 1967; Syrovátka had defected to Canada in 1971 and owned a ski boutique in Montreal.[15][12][16]She claimed at the time to be married to Syrovátka, though the two never wed.[18][19]Ivana worked as a ski instructor while living in Canada.[20]She lived inMontrealfor two years where she continued to improve her English via night courses atMcGill University.[16]Working as a model, Ivana told theMontreal Gazettein 1975 that she considered modelling to be a job, rather than a career.[21]Her modelling clients includedEaton\\'sdepartment store and the fashion designer Auckie Sanft, along with promotional work for the1976 Summer Olympicsin Montreal.[16]Marriage to Donald Trump[edit]Ivana and Donald Trump in receiving line of state dinner for KingFahd of Saudi Arabiain 1985, with U.S. presidentRonald Reaganand First LadyNancy ReaganIvana was inNew York Citywith a group of models in 1976 when she met Donald Trump.[16]On April 9, 1977, the couple married atMarble Collegiate Churchin a wedding officiated byNorman Vincent Peale.[22][23][24][25]They became tabloid figures in New York society during the 1980s and worked together on several large projects, including theTrump ToweronFifth Avenuein Manhattan, the renovation of theGrand Hyatt Hotelin New York City, and the construction of theTrump Taj Mahal Casino ResortinAtlantic City, New Jersey.[26][27]Ivana (on the right) andEstée Lauderat aRed Crossball in Palm Beach in 1986Ivana greeting First LadyBarbara Bushin 1990During the marriage, Ivana and Donald had three children:Donald Jr.(born 1977),Ivana (Ivanka) Marie(born 1981), andEric(born 1984). Donald Jr. learned to speak fluentCzech(with the help of his maternal grandfather), while Ivanka gained only a basic understanding of her mother\\'s native tongue, and Eric was not exposed to the language since his grandparents were comfortable using English.[28][29]A reviewer of the 2018Netflixdocumentary miniseries on Donald,Trump: An American Dream,described Ivana as a \"charismatic workaholic, a career woman, an equal\", and a life partner deliberately chosen by Trump to \"work beside him and challenge him.\"[30]The Trumps\\' troubled marriage became the subject of public interest over theChristmas holidayin 1989 when—on vacation inAspen, Colorado—they were observed fighting after Ivana encountered Donald\\'s mistressMarla Maples.[31]TheChicago Tribunereported that by February 1990, Donald had locked Ivana out of her office at thePlaza Hotel, and a legal battle ensued over the legitimacy of the fourprenuptialagreements the pair had successively negotiated over the years.[31]In October 1990, Ivana\\'s 63-year-old father, Miloš Zelníček, died suddenly from a heart attack. According toThe Guardian, her father was an informer for Czechoslovakia\\'sStátní bezpečnost(StB)intelligence servicewho relayed information from his daughter, including a correct prediction thatGeorge H. W.
