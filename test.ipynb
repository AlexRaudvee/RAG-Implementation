His extravagant lifestyle, outspoken manner, and role on theNBCreality showThe Apprenticehave made hima well-known public figure in American lifefor nearly half a century.Trump began his career athis father\\'sreal estate company, Trump Management, in 1968 which he took over in 1971 and later renamedthe Trump Organizationin 1973. He expanded its business toManhattan, where his father\\'s financial and political backing enabled him to do his first deals, demolishing and renovating landmark buildings. Trump entered various businesses that did not require capital funding, including licensing his name to lodging andgolf courseenterprises around the world. Building on his public persona in the New York tabloid press, he later starred in the reality TV showThe Apprentice.Trump partly or completely owned several beauty pageants between 1996 and 2015. He has marketed his name to many building projects andcommercial products. Trump\\'s unsuccessful business ventures have included numerous casinos and hotel bankruptcies, the folding of hisNew Jersey Generalsfootball team, and the now-defunctTrump University. He and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.After winning the2016 presidential electionand beinginaugurated the first time in January 2017, Trump resigned all management roles within the Trump Organization and moved his business assets into arevocable trustmanaged by his sonsDonald Jr.andEric.[1]However, Trump retained his financial stake in the work document, which led to concerns about possible conflicts of interest.[2][needs update]Real estate[edit]See also:The Trump OrganizationTrump International Hotel and TowerEarly career[edit]Trump began his real estate career at his father\\'s company,[3]Trump Management,[4]which focused on middle-class rental housing in the New York CityboroughsofBrooklyn,Queens, andStaten Island. One of Trump\\'s first projects was the attempted turnaround of the troubled Swifton Village apartment complex inCincinnati, Ohio, which his father,Fred Trump, had purchased at foreclosure for $5.7\\xa0million in 1962, equivalent to $57 million in 2023.[5]Fred and Donald Trump became involved in the project. By the time Trump graduated from college in 1968, he was receiving the 2019 equivalent of $1,000,000 a year in untaxed gifts from his father.[6]At age 23, he made an unsuccessful commercial foray into show business, investing $70,000 to become co-producer of the 1970 Broadway comedyParis Is Out![7]TheTrump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower(center) inPanama City, PanamaHe was made the president of the company in 1971 and began using \"The Trump Organization\" as an umbrella brand.[8][9]In that year, at the age of 25, he also moved to Manhattan, where he took part in larger construction projects and used glitzy architectural design to foster media attention.[10]In 1973, theJustice Departmentalleged that the Trump Organization discriminated against prospective black tenants, rather than just screening out low-income applicants as they said. The Department of Justice said that black \"testers\" were sent to more than half a dozen buildings and were denied apartments, but a similar white tester would then be offered an apartment in the same building.[11]Ultimately the Trumps\\' company and federal officials signed an agreement under which the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and under which qualified minority applicants would be presented by the Urban League.[12][13]By 1973, Trump as president of the Trump Organization oversaw 14,000 apartments across Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. In 1978, the city selected his site on theWest Sideof Manhattan as the location for itsJacob Javits Convention Center, after finding that he was the only bidder who had a site ready for the project.[12]He received abroker\\'sfee on the property sale.Trump\\'s first major deal in Manhattan[14]was the development of theGrand Hyatt Hotelin 1978 next toGrand Central Terminal. The aging brick facade of the Commodore Hotel was sheathed in glass, and the existing lobby of the hotel was replaced by an atrium.[15]The Commodore was thus presented as a remodeled Hyatt hotel at its opening in September 1980, helping to bring Trump to public prominence.[15][16]Part of this deal was a $1\\xa0million loan Fred Trump\\'s Village Construction Corp. made to help repay draws on a Chase Manhattan credit line Fred had arranged for Donald as he built the hotel, as well as a $70\\xa0million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred and the Hyatt hotel chain. Fred was a silent partner in the initiative, due to his reputation having been damaged in New York real estate circles, after investigations into windfall profits and other abuses in his real estate projects, making Donald the frontman in the deal. According to journalist Wayne Barrett, Fred\\'s two-decade friendship with a top Equitable officer, Ben Holloway, helped convince them to agree to the project.[14]Donald negotiated a 40-year tax abatement for the hotel with the city, in exchange for a share of the venture\\'s profits. The deal helped reduce the risk of the project and provided an incentive for investors to participate.[17]In 1981, Trump purchased and renovated a building that would become the Trump Plaza, onThird Avenuein New York City.[18]Trump made this into anapartment cooperative, in which tenants partly owned the building.[18]Trump Tower[edit]Main article:Trump TowerTheTrump Tower, onFifth AvenueinMidtown ManhattanIn 1983, Trump completed development ofTrump Tower, a 58-story skyscraper inMidtown Manhattan. The project involved complicated negotiations with different parties for theBonwit Tellerbuilding, the land, and the airspace above a neighboring building. When negotiations were completed in 1978,The New York Timeswrote \"That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location ... is testimony to [his] persistence and to his skills as a negotiator.\"[19]Trump Tower occupies the former site of the architecturally significant Bonwit Tellerflagship store, which Trump demolished in 1980 after purchasing the site.[20][21]There was public outrage when valuableArt Decobas-relief sculptures on its facade, which had been promised to theMetropolitan Museum of Artby Trump, were destroyed on the orders of the Trump Organization during the demolition process.[20][21]In addition, the demolition of the Bonwit Teller store was criticized for a contractor\\'s use of some 200 illegal Polish immigrant workers, who, during the rushed demolition process, were reportedly paid 4–5 dollars per hour for work in 12-hour shifts.[22][23]Trump testified in 1990 that he rarely visited the site and was unaware of the illegal workers, some of whom lived at the site and who were known as the \"Polish Brigade\". A judge ruled in 1991 that the builders engaged in \"a conspiracy to deprive the funds of their rightful contribution\", referring to the pension and welfare funds of the labor unions.[24]However, on appeal, parts of that ruling were overturned,[25]and the record became sealed when the long-running labor lawsuit was settled in 1999, after 16 years in court.[22][23]Trump Tower was developed by Trump and theEquitable Life Assurance Company, and was designed by architectDer ScuttofSwanke Hayden Connell.[26]Trump Tower houses both the primarypenthousecondominiumresidence of Donald Trump and the headquarters of the Trump Organization.[27]The building includes shops, cafés, offices, and residences. Its five-level atrium features a 60-foot-high waterfall spanned by a suspended walkway, below a skylight.[28]Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television showThe Apprenticeincluding a fully functional television studio set.[29]When the building was completed, its condominiums sold quickly and the tower became a tourist attraction.[30]Expansion[edit]Harrah\\'s at Trump Plazaopened in Atlantic City in 1984. The hotel/casino was built by Trump with financing by Holiday Corp.[31]and operated by the Harrah\\'s gambling unit of Holiday Corp. The casino\\'s poor results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp.[32]Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320\\xa0million. When completed in 1985, the hotel/casino became Trump Castle. Trump\\'s wife,Ivana, managed the property.[33]Trump acquired theMar-a-Lagoestate inPalm Beach, Florida, in 1985 for $5\\xa0million, plus $3\\xa0million for the home\\'s furnishings. In addition to using the home as a winter retreat, Trump also turned it into a private club with membership fees of $150,000. At about the same time, he acquired a condominium complex in West Palm Beach withLee Iacoccathat becameTrump Plaza of the Palm Beaches.[34]Central Park\\'sWollman Rinkafter the Trump renovationIn 1980, repairs began onCentral Park\\'sWollman Rink, with an anticipated two-and-a-half\\xa0year construction time frame. Because of flaws in the design and numerous problems during construction, the project remained unfinished by May 1986 and was estimated to require another 18 months and $2\\xa0million to $3\\xa0million to complete.[35][36]Trump was awarded a contract as the general contractor in June 1986 to finish the repairs by December 15 with a cost ceiling of $3\\xa0million, with the actual costs to be reimbursed by the city. Trump hired an architect, a construction company, and a Canadian ice-rink manufacturer and completed the work in four months, $775,000 under budget.[36]He operated the rink for a year and gave some of the profits to charity and public works projects[37]in exchange for the rink\\'sconcessionrights.[38][36]Trump managed the rink from 1987 to 1995. He received another contract in 2001 which was extended until 2021.[39][40]According to journalistJoyce Purnick, Trump\\'s \"Wollman success was also the stuff of a carefully crafted, self-promotional legend.\"[39]While the work was in progress, Trump called numerous press conferences, for example for the completion of the laying of the pipes and the pouring of the cement.[41]In 1987, he also unsuccessfully tried to get the city to rename the landmark after him; the Trump logo is prominently displayed on the railing encircling the rink, on theZamboni,[39]on the rental skates,[40]and on the rink\\'s website.[40][42]Trump unveiled a plan to construct a miniature city within New York City on the \"largest available undeveloped tract\" of land on the island ofManhattanon November 30, 1984.[43]The Television City proposal, later called Trump City, would consist of \"nearly 8,000 apartments and condominiums for up to 20,000 people, almost 10,000 parking spots, some 3.6 million square feet of television and movie studio space, and some 2 million square feet of \\'prestigious\\' stores.\"[44]To stand above all other buildings would have been an uncommonly tall skyscraper for the time, to be twice the height of the 76-story buildings beneath it.[44]An organization of celebrities called Westpride, consisting of such individuals asJerry Seinfeld,Christopher Reeve, and others, was formed and fundraised in opposition to the proposal.[44]MayorEd Kochdenied Trump tax breaks to help him develop his proposal, instead giving them toNBCto thwart the possibility of them relocating fromRockefeller Centerto Trump\\'s concept.[44]Trump acquired thePlaza Hotelin Manhattan in 1988. He paid $400\\xa0million for the property and once again tapped Ivana to manage its operation and renovation.[45]Trump Taj Mahal, at 1000 Boardwalk inAtlantic City, New JerseyLater in 1988, Trump acquired theTaj Mahal CasinoinAtlantic City, New Jersey, in a transaction withMerv GriffinandResorts International.[46]The casino was opened in April 1990, and was built at a total cost of $1.1 billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever built.[47][48]Financed with $675\\xa0million injunk bonds[49]at a 14% interest rate, the project enteredChapter 11bankruptcy the following year.[50]Banks andbondholders, facing potential losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, opted torestructurethe debt. In late 1990, Trump and Westpride negotiated an alternative proposal to scrap Trump\\'s original concept for Trump City and instead buildRiverside South, devoid of Trump\\'s tall skyscraper and instead consisting of a park and shorter buildings than the originally proposed 76-story ones.[44][51]Architecture criticPaul Goldbergerwrote forThe New York Timesin August 1991, \"Mr. Trump knew that it would be a freezing day in August before his own plan could ever win approval and, like any skillful politician, he jumped on the opposition bandwagon so deftly that he made it look like his own.\"[44][51]The Taj Mahal emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50% ownership in the casino to the bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and more time to pay off the debt.[52]He also sold his financially challengedTrump Shuttleairline and his 282-foot (86\\xa0m)megayacht, theTrump Princess.[49][53][54]Trump would gain the financial backing for Riverside South fromHong Kong-based businessmen for around $90 million, which would help pay for dues on the property Trump owed to banks and onback taxes, with Trump collecting a 30% ownership stake and maintaining daily construction. According to a lawyer close to the negotiations, the agreement almost fell apart after Trump \"used a string of foul language, including racial epithets regarding Asians\" during the negotiations. The agreement helped Trump avoid personal bankruptcy after having to file for corporate bankruptcy four times prior.[44]The Taj Mahal property was repurchased in 1996 and consolidated intoTrump Hotels & Casino Resorts, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004 with $1.8\\xa0billion in debt, filing again for bankruptcy five years later with $50\\xa0million in assets and $500\\xa0million in debt. The restructuring ultimately left Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[54]Trump served as chairman of the organization, which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 until early 2009, and served as CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2005.[55]Business bankruptcies[edit]Further information:Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump §\\xa0Use of bankruptcy lawsAlthough Trump has never filed forpersonal bankruptcy, hotels and casino businesses of his have declaredbankruptcy[56]six times between 1991 and 2009 due to its inability to meet required payments and to re-negotiate debt with banks, owners of stock and bonds and various small businesses (unsecured creditors).[57][58]Because the businesses usedChapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted byNewsweekin 2011 saying, \"I do play with the bankruptcy laws—they\\'re very good for me.\"[59][60]The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York:Trump Taj Mahal(1991),Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino(1992),Plaza Hotel(1992),Trump Castle Hotel and Casino(1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), andTrump Entertainment Resorts(2009).[56][61][62]Trump said \"I\\'ve used the laws of this country to pare debt. ... We\\'ll have the company. We\\'ll throw it into a chapter. We\\'ll negotiate with the banks. We\\'ll make a fantastic deal. You know, it\\'s like onThe Apprentice. It\\'s not personal. It\\'s just business.\"[50]Inheritance and further acquisitions[edit]In 1996, Trump acquired a vacant, 70-story office building at40 Wall Streetin Manhattan, renovated it, and branded it asThe Trump Building.[63]In 1998,Consecoand Trump purchased the General Motors Building for $878 million fromCorporate Property Investors.[64][65][66]The group received a $700 million loan fromLehman Brothersfor the purchase and Trump reportedly only committed $15 to $20 million of his own money to the deal.[67]Trump raised the controversial sunken plaza where few pedestrians had ventured, which had been criticized by Huxtable[clarification needed], and installed his name in four-foot gold letters.[68]In 2003, Trump and partners sold the building for $1.4 billion, then the highest price paid for a North American office building, toMacklowe Organization.[69][70]After his father died in 1999, Trump and his siblings received equal portions[citation needed]of his father\\'s estate valued at $250–300\\xa0million.[71]In 2001, Trump completedTrump World Tower, a 72-story residential tower across from theUnited Nations Headquarters.[72]Trump also began construction onRiverside South, which he dubbedTrump Place, a multi-building development along theHudson River. He continued to own commercial space inTrump International Hotel and Tower, a 44-story mixed-use (hotel and condominium) tower onColumbus Circlewhich he acquired in 1996,[73]and also continued to own millions of square feet of other primeManhattanreal estate.[74]Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico in Manhattan in 2002. It was re-opened with 35 stories of luxury condominiums in 2004 as theTrump Park Avenue.[75]Trump has owned a house on NorthRodeo Drivein theBeverly Hills, California/Los Angelesarea, bought for $7 million, since 2007. He bought a home next door in 2008 fromOmar Bongo, the president ofGabonwho would die in office in 2009, for $10.35 million. Trump sold the second LA home, built in 1981, for $9,500,095 in 2009 for an $850,000 (8%) loss. The second house went back on the market in mid-2016 listed at nearly $30 million.[76]Trump haslicensed his name and imagefor the development of a number of real estate projects including two Trump-branded real estate projects in Florida that have gone into foreclosure.[77]The Turkish owner ofTrump Towers Istanbul, who pays Trump for the use of his name, was reported in December 2015 to be exploring legal means to dissociate the property after the candidate\\'s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[78]Trump also licensed his name to son-in-lawJared Kushner\\'s 50-storyTrump Bay Street, aJersey Cityluxury development that has raised $50\\xa0million of its $200\\xa0million capitalization largely from wealthyChinese nationalswho, after making an initial down payment of $500,000 in concert with the government\\'s expeditedEB-5 visaprogram, can usually obtain United States permanent residency for themselves and their families after two years.[79]Trump is a partner withKushner Propertiesonly in name licensing and not in the building\\'s financing.[79]In 2012, the 1290 Avenue of the Americas skyscraper in Manhattan wasrefinanced; Trump had a 30% stake in the building. The refinancing led to $211 million of debt being accrued with the state-ownedBank of China. This was the first instance of a Chinese bank engaging incommercial mortgage-backed securitiesin the United States. The Bank of China sold the debt in 2012 into the market, and thus no longer had \"any ownership interest in that loan\" thereafter, it stated. A 2017 document filed in New York City erroneously listed the Bank of China as a currentcreditordue to a mistake by loan servicer organizationWells Fargo.[80][81][82]Golf courses[edit]See also:Donald Trump and golfTurnberry HotelinSouth Ayrshire, ScotlandThe Trump Organization operates manygolf coursesand resorts in the United States and around the world. The number of golf courses that Trump owns or manages is about 18, according toGolfweek.[83]Trump\\'s personal financial disclosure with theFederal Elections Commissionstated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382\\xa0million.[84][85]In 2006, Trump bought the Menie Estate inBalmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, creating a golf resort against the wishes of local residents[86]on an area designated as aSite of Special Scientific Interest.[87][88]A 2011 independent documentary,You\\'ve Been Trumped,by British filmmaker Anthony Baxter, chronicled the golf resort\\'s construction and the subsequent struggles between the locals and Donald Trump.[89]In December 2015, Trump\\'s appeal objecting to an offshore windfarm (Aberdeen Bay Wind Farm) within sight of the golf links was denied.[90]Despite Trump\\'s promises of 6,000 jobs, in 2016, by his own admission, the golf course has created only 200 jobs.[91]In June 2019,Scottish Natural Heritageruled that the golf course had \"destroyed\" the sand dune system, causing permanent habitat loss, and recommended that the SSSI status be revoked.[92]The special status was removed in December 2020.[93]In April 2014, Trump purchased theTurnberryhotel and golf resort inAyrshire, Scotland, which was a regular fixture inthe Open Championshiprota.[94][95]After the2021 United States Capitol attack, the organizer of the championship,The R&A, announced that The Open would not be held again at Turnberry as long as its links to the Trump Organization remained.[96][97]Professional sports[edit]See also:Donald Trump and American footballTrump delivers remarks at a press conference for theNew Jersey Generalsin 1985.President Donald J. Trump waves to the crowd during Game 5 of the MLB World Series between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019, at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.In 1983, Trump\\'sNew Jersey Generalsbecame a charter member of the newUnited States Football League(USFL). Before the inaugural season began in 1983, Trump sold the franchise toOklahomaoil magnate J. Walter Duncan, and bought it back after the season. He then attempted to hire longtimeMiami DolphinscoachDon Shula, but the deal fell apart because he was unwilling to meet Shula\\'s demand for an apartment inTrump Tower. Trump ended up hiring formerNew York JetscoachWalt Michaels.[98][99][100]The USFL played its first three seasons during the spring and summer, but Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL 1986 schedule to the fall, directly opposite theNational Football League(NFL), arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL, which would supposedly increase their investment significantly.[101]Before the 1985 season, Trump signedHeisman Trophy-winning quarterbackDoug Flutieto a $7\\xa0million 5-year personal-services contract. That made Flutie the highest-paid pro football player at the time, as well as the highest-paidrookiein any professional sport.[102]After the season, the Generals merged with theHouston Gamblers. Trump owned 50% of the newly merged team, which would stay in New Jersey and retain the Generals nickname. At the time, Trump boasted \"it\\'s probably the best team in football.\" (New Jersey and Houston both had good but not great seasons in 1985: they each made the playoffs but lost first-round games.)The Generals never played another game.[103]The 1986 season was cancelled after the USFL won apyrrhic victoryin anantitrustlawsuit against the NFL: the NFL technically lost the suit, but the USFL was awarded just $3.00 in cash damages. The USFL, which was down to just 7 active franchises from a high of 18, folded soon afterward.[98]Trump had expressed an interest in purchasing theCleveland Indiansfor $13\\xa0million in a February 15, 1983 letter sent byKenneth Molloyto team presidentGabe Paul. Trump increased his offer to $34\\xa0million later that same year. His lack of commitment to keep the franchise inClevelandbeyond three years cost him any chance of completing the acquisition.[104]Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded, operating golf courses in several countries.[98]He also hosted several boxing matches in Atlantic City at the Trump Plaza, includingMike Tyson\\'s 1988 fightagainstMichael Spinks, and at one time acted as a financial advisor forTyson.[98][105][106]In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to theTour de Trumpcycling stage racewhich was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as theTour de Franceor theGiro d\\'Italia. The name was suggested by his business partner, basketball commentatorBilly Packer, who originally planned to call the race the Tour deJersey. The first stage of the inaugural race ended in the college town ofNew Paltz, New Yorkwhere picketers greeted the riders with anti-Trump signs. The second stage began in New York City, andMayorEd Koch, who had denounced Trump as \"one of the great hucksters\", boycotted the event. The last stage of the 10-stage 837-mile race was even more controversial. Going into the last stage, Belgian riderEric Vanderaerdenwas favored to win the tour championship, but lost at least 1 minute 20 seconds when he took a wrong turn on a poorly marked course inAtlantic City, riding a quarter-mile or more out of his way. He ended up finishing third overall, behind tour winnerDag-Otto Lauritzen(a Norwegian rider with the American-owned7-Eleven team) and runner-upHenk Lubberding, who also took a wrong turn during the last stage. Trump withdrew his sponsorship after the second Tour de Trump in 1990 because his other business ventures were experiencing financial woes. The race continued for several more years as the Tour DuPont.[107][108]Trump submitted astalking-horse bidon theBuffalo Billswhen it came up for sale followingRalph Wilson\\'s death in 2014; he was ultimately outbid, as he expected, andKimandTerrence Pegulawon the auction.[109]During his 2016 presidential run, he was critical of the NFL\\'supdated concussion rules, complaining on the campaign trail that the game has been made \"soft\" and \"weak\", saying a concussion is just \"a ding on the head.\" He accused referees of throwingpenalty flagsneedlessly just to be seen on television \"so their wives see them at home.\"[110]In 2012, Scottish soccer clubRangerswas in financial turmoil, leading to itsliquidation and refounding. Trump considered buying the club, before backing out due to the extent of its financial issues.[111][112]Beauty pageants[edit]Further information:Miss USA,Miss Universe, andMiss Teen USAFrom 1996 until 2015, when he sold his interests,[113]Trump owned part or all of theMiss Universe,Miss USA, andMiss Teen USAbeauty pageants.Miss Universe debuted onCBS, and both Miss Universe and Miss USA moved toNBCin 2002.[114][115]In 2012, Trump won a $5\\xa0million arbitration award against a contestant who claimed the show was rigged.[116]In 2015, NBC andUnivisionboth ended their business relationships with the Miss Universe Organization during Trump\\'s presidential campaign .[117][118]Trump later announced that he had become the sole owner of the Miss Universe Organization by purchasing NBC\\'s stake.[119]He sold his own interests in the pageant shortly afterwards, toWME/IMG.[113]In 1999, a few years after buying into Miss Universe, Trump founded a modeling company,Trump Model Management, which operates in theSoHoneighborhood ofLower Manhattan.[120]Together with another Trump company, Trump Management Group LLC, Trump Model Management has brought hundreds of foreign fashion models into the United States to work in thefashion industrysince 2000.[121]This business and the beauty pageants overlapped somewhat, with various pageant contestants getting modelling contracts.[122]Trump University[edit]Main articles:Trump UniversityandCohen v. Trump (Trump University)Trump University LLC[123]was an Americanfor-profit educationcompany that ran a real estate training program from 2005 until at least 2010. After multiple lawsuits, it is now defunct. It was founded by Donald Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny.[124]The company offered courses in real estate, asset management, entrepreneurship, and wealth creation, charging between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[125]In 2005 the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the operation was changed to the \"Trump Entrepreneurial Institute\".[126]Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[127]In 2013 the state of New York filed a $40\\xa0million civil suit claiming that Trump University made false claims and defrauded consumers.[126][128]In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits relating to Trump University were filed in federal court; they named Donald Trump personally as well as his companies.[129]All three cases were settled in November 2016, after Trump\\'s election to the presidency, for a total of $25 million.[130]Trump repeatedly criticized a judge,Gonzalo P. Curiel, who is overseeing two of the Trump University cases. During campaign speeches and interviews up until June 2016, Trump called Curiel a \"hater of Donald Trump\", saying his rulings have been unfair, and that Curiel \"happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that\\'s fine\",[131]while suggesting that the judge\\'s ethnicity posed a conflict of interest in light of Trump\\'s proposal to build a wall on the United States–Mexican border.[132][133][134]Many legal experts were critical of Trump\\'s attacks on Curiel, often viewing them as racially charged, unfounded, and an affront to the concept of an independent judiciary.[135][136][137]On June 7, 2016, Trump issued a lengthy statement saying that his criticism of the judge had been \"misconstrued\" and that his concerns about Curiel\\'s impartiality were not based upon ethnicity alone, but also upon rulings in the case.[138][139]ACN, Inc.[edit]From 2005 to 2015, Trump was paid $8.8\\xa0million for promoting multi-level marketing telecommunications companyACN Inc.and its products on ACN\\'s website,[140]promotional DVDs and at their events, and on hisThe Apprenticereality-TV show.[141][142]In 2018, four investors filed a federal civil lawsuit in theSouthern District of New Yorkagainst Donald Trump and his children Donald Jr.,Ivanka, and Eric for fraud and racketeering. In July 2019, a  district judge permitted the lawsuit to proceed with state-level claims of fraud, false advertising, and unfair competition.[143][144][145]The Trumps were accused of not having disclosed that they were being paid by ACN when they recommended the company as a sound investment. As part of the discovery process, the Trumps were ordered in March 2020 to provide information from Trump Organization business records back to 2005.[146]In April 2020, a federal judge orderedMGM, the majority owner ofCelebrity Apprentice, to release unaired tapes of two episodes of the show to the attorneys of plaintiffs who accused the four Trumps of misleading them to invest in ACN; in the episodes, celebrity contestants competed to produce commercials for an ACN product.[147]The Trumps appealed the ruling and unsuccessfully sought to deal with the dispute viaarbitration.[148]In November 2021, a federal judge ordered MGM to make the tapes available to the plaintiffs\\' attorneys at a secure location.[147]Trump and his children were deposed in 2022.[149][150]In May 2023, the plaintiffs withdrew their claims against the children in order to \"to streamline the dispute ahead of a trial\".[151]The trial is scheduled for January 29, 2024.[152]Donald J. Trump Foundation[edit]Main article:Donald J. Trump FoundationThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a U.S.-basedprivate foundation[153]established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the bookTrump: The Art of the Dealby Trump andTony Schwartz.[154][155]The foundation\\'s funds mostly came from donors other than Trump,[156]whose last personal contribution to the charity was in 2008.[156]The top donors to the foundation from 2004 to 2014 wereVinceandLinda McMahonofWorld Wrestling Entertainment, who donated $5\\xa0million to the foundation after Trump appeared atWrestleManiain 2007.[156]Per the foundation\\'s tax returns, its benefactors included healthcare and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[157]In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to theArnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation($100,000), theNew York Presbyterian Hospital($125,000), thePolice Athletic League($156,000), and theClinton Foundation($100,000).[158][159]Starting in 2016The Washington Postbegan reporting on how the foundation raised and granted money. ThePostuncovered several potential legal and ethical violations, such as allegedself-dealingand possible tax evasion.[160]TheNew York State attorney generalis investigating the foundation \"to make sure it is complying with the laws governing charities in New York.\"[161][162]A Trump spokesman called the investigation a \"partisan hit job\".[161]On October 3, 2016, the New York attorney general\\'s office notified the Trump Foundation that it was in violation of New York laws regarding charities and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in the state of New York. The foundation, which had also admitted to engaging in self-dealing on its 2015 IRS form, agreed to this order.[163]A 2018 suit by the New York State attorney general alleged that Trump had illegally used foundation funds to buy self-portraits, pay off his businesses\\' legal obligations, and boost his presidential campaign. The judge ruled against the Donald J. Trump Foundation and ordered Trump to pay $2 million in damages. Trump agreed to give that money and the foundation\\'s remaining $1.8 million to 8 charities ranging from Army Emergency Relief to the United Negro College Fund to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and to dissolve the foundation.[164]Branding and licensing[edit]Further information:List of things named after Donald TrumpTheTrumplogo on a hotel in ChicagoTrump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects as well as commercial products and services, achieving mixed success doing so for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[165][166][nb 1]In 2011,Forbes\\'financial experts estimated the value of the Trumpbrandat $200\\xa0million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3\\xa0billion.[185]Many developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects.[186]For that reason, Trump does not own many of the buildings that display his name.[186]According toForbes, this portion of Trump\\'s empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562\\xa0million valuation. According toForbes, there are 33 licensing projects under development including seven \"condo hotels\" (the seven Trump International Hotel and Tower developments). In June 2015,Forbespegged the Trump brand at $125\\xa0million[187]as retailers likeMacy\\'s Inc.andSerta Mattressesbegan dropping Trump-branded products.[188][189]The value of the Trump brand may have fallen due to his presidential campaign. After his 2016 campaign started, an internalYoung & Rubicamstudy of Trump\\'s brand among high-income consumers showed \"plummeting\" ratings for traits such as \"prestigious\", \"upper class\", and \"glamorous\" at the end of 2015, suggesting that Trump\\'s various businesses could face market difficulties and financing challenges in the future.[190]Some consumers say they are avoiding purchasing Trump-branded products and services as a protest against Trump and his campaign.[191]Bookings and foot traffic at Trump-branded hotels and casinos fell off sharply in 2016, primarily driven by a decrease in visits to the properties by women.[192][193]Following the release of theAccess Hollywoodtape recordingsin October 2016, the value of the Trump brand was reported to have taken a further hit, with estimates of the reduction in the brand\\'s added value of up to 13percentage points.[194][195]In March 2024, Trump began promoting the $60God Bless the U.S.A. Bible, which features a King James translation of the Bible; the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, and Pledge of Allegiance; as well as the handwritten chorus of theLee GreenwoodsongGod Bless the U.S.A.. The website selling the Bible bills it as \"the only Bible endorsed by\" Trump and that his \"name, likeness and image\" are being used under paid license from one of Trump\\'s organizations, CIC Ventures LLC.[196][197]Stocks, bonds, funds, and similar holdings[edit]Trump\\'s personal financial market investment portfolio is concentrated in the financial and commodities markets.[198][199]The investment portfolio generates income and cash flow from a variety of mechanisms as dividends, capital gains, and compounded carried interest. He invested a minimum of $70 million in stocks.[200]Though real estate is still his most preferred asset class, Trump became an active financial market investor in 2011 following disappointment from the depressed American real estate market and various investments in the Federal Reserve\\'s interest yields onCDswere next to nothing.[201][202]Trump stated that he was not enthusiastic to be a stock market investor, but that prime real estate at good prices was hard to find at that time and that stocks and equity securities were cheap and generating good cash flow from dividends.[203]He profited from 40 of the 45 stocks he purchased which he sold in 2014, making it almost a 90% success rate incapital appreciationin addition to millions in earned dividends. The biggest gainers in his stock portfolio were Bank of America Corporation,The Boeing Companyand Facebook, Inc earning a windfall profit of $6.7 million, $3.96 million and $3.85 million, respectively.[200]Trump\\'s stock portfolio was valued somewhere between $33.4 million and $87.9 million in 2015 and was invested in many sectors, including public companies such as tobacco distributors, retail outlets, pharmaceutical companies, industrial manufacturing companies, financial conglomerates, oil companies, high technology firms and defense contractors.[204]Public stock investments within his portfolio includeGeneral Electric,Chevron,UPS,Coca-Cola,Home Depot,Comcast,Sanofi,Ford,ConocoPhillips,Energy Transfer Partners,Altera,Verizon Communications,Procter & Gamble,Bank of America,Nike,Google,Apple Inc.,Philip Morris,Citigroup,Morgan Stanley,Whole Foods,Intel,IBM,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Johnson & Johnson,Caterpillar,Kinder Morgan,AT&Tand Facebook.[203][205][206]He has at least $78 million invested in a variety of paper assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, private equity funds, fund of funds, and hedge funds.[207]His financial market investment accounts are kept atJPMorgan,Barclays,Deutsche BankandOppenheimer.[205][208]His Barclays account includes investments in 32 entities and cash worth between $49,021 and $396,001 and having stock in two accounts atDeutsche Bankthat contain cash, treasury bills, and stock in 173 entities. His investment account with Oppenheimer contains cash and has 31positionsworth between $10,380,031 and $33,301,000. His account with JPMorgan contains stock in 60 firms valued between $1,251,008 and $2,617,000.[209]Trump has also invested in funds that focus on middle and smaller sized businesses such asTesla Motors, the electric car maker and has invested internationally in a number of emerging market, growth and hedge funds located in Europe and Asia.[210]He has also invested in a number of private equity and hedge funds including $1 to $5 million in Advantage Plus, $1 to $5 million in AG Diversified Funds, $2 million inMidOcean Credit Opportunities, $4 million inPaulson & Co., and around $5 million withAngelo, Gordon & Co.[211][212][213]Trump\\'s biggest fund holding has been inBlack Rock\\'s Obsidian Fund, where his stake is estimated to be between $25 million to $50 million.[214]Nearly all of Trump\\'s open end mutual fund investments are concentrated in Baron Capital Management, a mid-sized mutual fund family headed by mutual fund mogulRonald S. Baron.[210][215]Trump invested $16.2 million in Baron Capital Management, making him a significant minority shareholder.[202]He revealed that he earned over $22 million with his private equity, hedge fund, and mutual fund investments and generated between $1.5 million and $10 million in income almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest.[216]Trump also has a portion of his portfolio invested inU.S. Treasury bonds.[214]On a government form submitted in 2015, Trump reported holding an amount of physical gold, valued at between $100,001 to $250,000.[217]Taxes and income[edit]Main article:Tax returns of Donald TrumpSee also:Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016andWealth of Donald TrumpTrump released some financial information in 2015,[84]but declined to publicly release any of his full tax returns,[218]though he said he would do so before the 2016 election if what his attorneys described as an ongoingaudit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)was completed covering tax returns for the years 2009 through 2016.[219][220]According to a July 2015 press release from his campaign manager, Trump\\'s \"income\" for the year 2014 was $362\\xa0million (\"which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties\").[221]His disclosure filings for the year 2015 stated that his total gross revenue was in excess of $611\\xa0million.[84]Fortunemagazine has reported that the $362\\xa0million figure as stated on hisFederal Election Commission(FEC) filings is not \"income\" but gross revenue before salaries, interest payments on outstanding debt, and other business-related expenses; Trump\\'s net income was \"most likely\" about one-third of that.[222][223]According to public records, Trump received a $302 New York tax rebate in 2013 (and in two other recent years) given to couples earning less than $500,000 per year, who submit as proof their federal tax returns.[223]Trump\\'s campaign manager has suggested that Trump\\'s tax rebate was an error.[223]In October 2016, it was revealed that Trump had claimed a loss of $916 million on his 1995 tax returns. Astax lossesfrom one year can be applied to offset income from future years, the $916 million loss allowed him to reduce or eliminate his taxable income (and consequently his US federal income taxes) during the eighteen-year carry forward period.[224]Trump acknowledged he used the loss but declined to provide details such as the specific years the loss was applied.[225]An investigative story by theNew York Timesfound that in the early 1990s in order to avoid \"financial ruin\" Trump\\'s businesses used methods which were \"legally dubious\" to avoid paying taxes, and that Trump\\'s own lawyers described these activities as \"improper\".[226]Independent tax experts stated that \"Whatever loophole existed was not \\'exploited\\' here, but stretched beyond any recognition\" and that it involved \"sleight of hand\". Since the taxes were related to the reduction in Trump\\'s extensive junk bond debt at the time and the bankruptcies of three of Trump\\'s casinos, the methods used were probably related, according to the report, to Trump\\'s reported $916 million loss reported on his 1995 tax return.[227]See also[edit]Business projects of Donald Trump in RussiaDonald Trump pseudonymsMedia career of Donald TrumpNotes[edit]^His external entrepreneurial and investment ventures includeTrump Financial(a mortgage firm), Trump Sales and Leasing (residential sales), Trump International Realty (a residential and commercial real estate brokerage firm),The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative(a for profit business education company, formerly called theTrump University), Trump Restaurants (located in Trump Tower and consisting of Trump Buffet, Trump Catering, Trump Ice Cream Parlor, and Trump Bar), GoTrump (an online travel search engine[167][168][169]), Select By Trump (a line of coffee drinks),[170]Trump Drinks (an energy drink for the Israeli and Palestinian markets)[171][172][173][174]Donald J.

His extravagant lifestyle, outspoken manner, and role on theNBCreality showThe Apprenticehave made hima well-known public figure in American lifefor nearly half a century.Trump began his career athis father\\'sreal estate company, Trump Management, in 1968 which he took over in 1971 and later renamedthe Trump Organizationin 1973. He expanded its business toManhattan, where his father\\'s financial and political backing enabled him to do his first deals, demolishing and renovating landmark buildings. Trump entered various businesses that did not require capital funding, including licensing his name to lodging andgolf courseenterprises around the world. Building on his public persona in the New York tabloid press, he later starred in the reality TV showThe Apprentice.Trump partly or completely owned several beauty pageants between 1996 and 2015. He has marketed his name to many building projects andcommercial products. Trump\\'s unsuccessful business ventures have included numerous casinos and hotel bankruptcies, the folding of hisNew Jersey Generalsfootball team, and the now-defunctTrump University. He and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.After winning the2016 presidential electionand beinginaugurated the first time in January 2017, Trump resigned all management roles within the Trump Organization and moved his business assets into arevocable trustmanaged by his sonsDonald Jr.andEric.[1]However, Trump retained his financial stake in the work document, which led to concerns about possible conflicts of interest.[2][needs update]Real estate[edit]See also:The Trump OrganizationTrump International Hotel and TowerEarly career[edit]Trump began his real estate career at his father\\'s company,[3]Trump Management,[4]which focused on middle-class rental housing in the New York CityboroughsofBrooklyn,Queens, andStaten Island. One of Trump\\'s first projects was the attempted turnaround of the troubled Swifton Village apartment complex inCincinnati, Ohio, which his father,Fred Trump, had purchased at foreclosure for $5.7\\xa0million in 1962, equivalent to $57 million in 2023.[5]Fred and Donald Trump became involved in the project. By the time Trump graduated from college in 1968, he was receiving the 2019 equivalent of $1,000,000 a year in untaxed gifts from his father.[6]At age 23, he made an unsuccessful commercial foray into show business, investing $70,000 to become co-producer of the 1970 Broadway comedyParis Is Out![7]TheTrump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower(center) inPanama City, PanamaHe was made the president of the company in 1971 and began using \"The Trump Organization\" as an umbrella brand.[8][9]In that year, at the age of 25, he also moved to Manhattan, where he took part in larger construction projects and used glitzy architectural design to foster media attention.[10]In 1973, theJustice Departmentalleged that the Trump Organization discriminated against prospective black tenants, rather than just screening out low-income applicants as they said. The Department of Justice said that black \"testers\" were sent to more than half a dozen buildings and were denied apartments, but a similar white tester would then be offered an apartment in the same building.[11]Ultimately the Trumps\\' company and federal officials signed an agreement under which the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing, and under which qualified minority applicants would be presented by the Urban League.[12][13]By 1973, Trump as president of the Trump Organization oversaw 14,000 apartments across Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. In 1978, the city selected his site on theWest Sideof Manhattan as the location for itsJacob Javits Convention Center, after finding that he was the only bidder who had a site ready for the project.[12]He received abroker\\'sfee on the property sale.Trump\\'s first major deal in Manhattan[14]was the development of theGrand Hyatt Hotelin 1978 next toGrand Central Terminal. The aging brick facade of the Commodore Hotel was sheathed in glass, and the existing lobby of the hotel was replaced by an atrium.[15]The Commodore was thus presented as a remodeled Hyatt hotel at its opening in September 1980, helping to bring Trump to public prominence.[15][16]Part of this deal was a $1\\xa0million loan Fred Trump\\'s Village Construction Corp. made to help repay draws on a Chase Manhattan credit line Fred had arranged for Donald as he built the hotel, as well as a $70\\xa0million construction loan jointly guaranteed by Fred and the Hyatt hotel chain. Fred was a silent partner in the initiative, due to his reputation having been damaged in New York real estate circles, after investigations into windfall profits and other abuses in his real estate projects, making Donald the frontman in the deal. According to journalist Wayne Barrett, Fred\\'s two-decade friendship with a top Equitable officer, Ben Holloway, helped convince them to agree to the project.[14]Donald negotiated a 40-year tax abatement for the hotel with the city, in exchange for a share of the venture\\'s profits. The deal helped reduce the risk of the project and provided an incentive for investors to participate.[17]In 1981, Trump purchased and renovated a building that would become the Trump Plaza, onThird Avenuein New York City.[18]Trump made this into anapartment cooperative, in which tenants partly owned the building.[18]Trump Tower[edit]Main article:Trump TowerTheTrump Tower, onFifth AvenueinMidtown ManhattanIn 1983, Trump completed development ofTrump Tower, a 58-story skyscraper inMidtown Manhattan. The project involved complicated negotiations with different parties for theBonwit Tellerbuilding, the land, and the airspace above a neighboring building. When negotiations were completed in 1978,The New York Timeswrote \"That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location ... is testimony to [his] persistence and to his skills as a negotiator.\"[19]Trump Tower occupies the former site of the architecturally significant Bonwit Tellerflagship store, which Trump demolished in 1980 after purchasing the site.[20][21]There was public outrage when valuableArt Decobas-relief sculptures on its facade, which had been promised to theMetropolitan Museum of Artby Trump, were destroyed on the orders of the Trump Organization during the demolition process.[20][21]In addition, the demolition of the Bonwit Teller store was criticized for a contractor\\'s use of some 200 illegal Polish immigrant workers, who, during the rushed demolition process, were reportedly paid 4–5 dollars per hour for work in 12-hour shifts.[22][23]Trump testified in 1990 that he rarely visited the site and was unaware of the illegal workers, some of whom lived at the site and who were known as the \"Polish Brigade\". A judge ruled in 1991 that the builders engaged in \"a conspiracy to deprive the funds of their rightful contribution\", referring to the pension and welfare funds of the labor unions.[24]However, on appeal, parts of that ruling were overturned,[25]and the record became sealed when the long-running labor lawsuit was settled in 1999, after 16 years in court.[22][23]Trump Tower was developed by Trump and theEquitable Life Assurance Company, and was designed by architectDer ScuttofSwanke Hayden Connell.[26]Trump Tower houses both the primarypenthousecondominiumresidence of Donald Trump and the headquarters of the Trump Organization.[27]The building includes shops, cafés, offices, and residences. Its five-level atrium features a 60-foot-high waterfall spanned by a suspended walkway, below a skylight.[28]Trump Tower was the setting of the NBC television showThe Apprenticeincluding a fully functional television studio set.[29]When the building was completed, its condominiums sold quickly and the tower became a tourist attraction.[30]Expansion[edit]Harrah\\'s at Trump Plazaopened in Atlantic City in 1984. The hotel/casino was built by Trump with financing by Holiday Corp.[31]and operated by the Harrah\\'s gambling unit of Holiday Corp. The casino\\'s poor results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp.[32]Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320\\xa0million. When completed in 1985, the hotel/casino became Trump Castle. Trump\\'s wife,Ivana, managed the property.[33]Trump acquired theMar-a-Lagoestate inPalm Beach, Florida, in 1985 for $5\\xa0million, plus $3\\xa0million for the home\\'s furnishings. In addition to using the home as a winter retreat, Trump also turned it into a private club with membership fees of $150,000. At about the same time, he acquired a condominium complex in West Palm Beach withLee Iacoccathat becameTrump Plaza of the Palm Beaches.[34]Central Park\\'sWollman Rinkafter the Trump renovationIn 1980, repairs began onCentral Park\\'sWollman Rink, with an anticipated two-and-a-half\\xa0year construction time frame. Because of flaws in the design and numerous problems during construction, the project remained unfinished by May 1986 and was estimated to require another 18 months and $2\\xa0million to $3\\xa0million to complete.[35][36]Trump was awarded a contract as the general contractor in June 1986 to finish the repairs by December 15 with a cost ceiling of $3\\xa0million, with the actual costs to be reimbursed by the city. Trump hired an architect, a construction company, and a Canadian ice-rink manufacturer and completed the work in four months, $775,000 under budget.[36]He operated the rink for a year and gave some of the profits to charity and public works projects[37]in exchange for the rink\\'sconcessionrights.[38][36]Trump managed the rink from 1987 to 1995. He received another contract in 2001 which was extended until 2021.[39][40]According to journalistJoyce Purnick, Trump\\'s \"Wollman success was also the stuff of a carefully crafted, self-promotional legend.\"[39]While the work was in progress, Trump called numerous press conferences, for example for the completion of the laying of the pipes and the pouring of the cement.[41]In 1987, he also unsuccessfully tried to get the city to rename the landmark after him; the Trump logo is prominently displayed on the railing encircling the rink, on theZamboni,[39]on the rental skates,[40]and on the rink\\'s website.[40][42]Trump unveiled a plan to construct a miniature city within New York City on the \"largest available undeveloped tract\" of land on the island ofManhattanon November 30, 1984.[43]The Television City proposal, later called Trump City, would consist of \"nearly 8,000 apartments and condominiums for up to 20,000 people, almost 10,000 parking spots, some 3.6 million square feet of television and movie studio space, and some 2 million square feet of \\'prestigious\\' stores.\"[44]To stand above all other buildings would have been an uncommonly tall skyscraper for the time, to be twice the height of the 76-story buildings beneath it.[44]An organization of celebrities called Westpride, consisting of such individuals asJerry Seinfeld,Christopher Reeve, and others, was formed and fundraised in opposition to the proposal.[44]MayorEd Kochdenied Trump tax breaks to help him develop his proposal, instead giving them toNBCto thwart the possibility of them relocating fromRockefeller Centerto Trump\\'s concept.[44]Trump acquired thePlaza Hotelin Manhattan in 1988. He paid $400\\xa0million for the property and once again tapped Ivana to manage its operation and renovation.[45]Trump Taj Mahal, at 1000 Boardwalk inAtlantic City, New JerseyLater in 1988, Trump acquired theTaj Mahal CasinoinAtlantic City, New Jersey, in a transaction withMerv GriffinandResorts International.[46]The casino was opened in April 1990, and was built at a total cost of $1.1 billion, which at the time made it the most expensive casino ever built.[47][48]Financed with $675\\xa0million injunk bonds[49]at a 14% interest rate, the project enteredChapter 11bankruptcy the following year.[50]Banks andbondholders, facing potential losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, opted torestructurethe debt. In late 1990, Trump and Westpride negotiated an alternative proposal to scrap Trump\\'s original concept for Trump City and instead buildRiverside South, devoid of Trump\\'s tall skyscraper and instead consisting of a park and shorter buildings than the originally proposed 76-story ones.[44][51]Architecture criticPaul Goldbergerwrote forThe New York Timesin August 1991, \"Mr. Trump knew that it would be a freezing day in August before his own plan could ever win approval and, like any skillful politician, he jumped on the opposition bandwagon so deftly that he made it look like his own.\"[44][51]The Taj Mahal emerged from bankruptcy on October 5, 1991, with Trump ceding 50% ownership in the casino to the bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and more time to pay off the debt.[52]He also sold his financially challengedTrump Shuttleairline and his 282-foot (86\\xa0m)megayacht, theTrump Princess.[49][53][54]Trump would gain the financial backing for Riverside South fromHong Kong-based businessmen for around $90 million, which would help pay for dues on the property Trump owed to banks and onback taxes, with Trump collecting a 30% ownership stake and maintaining daily construction. According to a lawyer close to the negotiations, the agreement almost fell apart after Trump \"used a string of foul language, including racial epithets regarding Asians\" during the negotiations. The agreement helped Trump avoid personal bankruptcy after having to file for corporate bankruptcy four times prior.[44]The Taj Mahal property was repurchased in 1996 and consolidated intoTrump Hotels & Casino Resorts, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004 with $1.8\\xa0billion in debt, filing again for bankruptcy five years later with $50\\xa0million in assets and $500\\xa0million in debt. The restructuring ultimately left Trump with 10% ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[54]Trump served as chairman of the organization, which was renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, from mid-1995 until early 2009, and served as CEO from mid-2000 to mid-2005.[55]Business bankruptcies[edit]Further information:Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump §\\xa0Use of bankruptcy lawsAlthough Trump has never filed forpersonal bankruptcy, hotels and casino businesses of his have declaredbankruptcy[56]six times between 1991 and 2009 due to its inability to meet required payments and to re-negotiate debt with banks, owners of stock and bonds and various small businesses (unsecured creditors).[57][58]Because the businesses usedChapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted byNewsweekin 2011 saying, \"I do play with the bankruptcy laws—they\\'re very good for me.\"[59][60]The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York:Trump Taj Mahal(1991),Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino(1992),Plaza Hotel(1992),Trump Castle Hotel and Casino(1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), andTrump Entertainment Resorts(2009).[56][61][62]Trump said \"I\\'ve used the laws of this country to pare debt. ... We\\'ll have the company. We\\'ll throw it into a chapter. We\\'ll negotiate with the banks. We\\'ll make a fantastic deal. You know, it\\'s like onThe Apprentice. It\\'s not personal. It\\'s just business.\"[50]Inheritance and further acquisitions[edit]In 1996, Trump acquired a vacant, 70-story office building at40 Wall Streetin Manhattan, renovated it, and branded it asThe Trump Building.[63]In 1998,Consecoand Trump purchased the General Motors Building for $878 million fromCorporate Property Investors.[64][65][66]The group received a $700 million loan fromLehman Brothersfor the purchase and Trump reportedly only committed $15 to $20 million of his own money to the deal.[67]Trump raised the controversial sunken plaza where few pedestrians had ventured, which had been criticized by Huxtable[clarification needed], and installed his name in four-foot gold letters.[68]In 2003, Trump and partners sold the building for $1.4 billion, then the highest price paid for a North American office building, toMacklowe Organization.[69][70]After his father died in 1999, Trump and his siblings received equal portions[citation needed]of his father\\'s estate valued at $250–300\\xa0million.[71]In 2001, Trump completedTrump World Tower, a 72-story residential tower across from theUnited Nations Headquarters.[72]Trump also began construction onRiverside South, which he dubbedTrump Place, a multi-building development along theHudson River. He continued to own commercial space inTrump International Hotel and Tower, a 44-story mixed-use (hotel and condominium) tower onColumbus Circlewhich he acquired in 1996,[73]and also continued to own millions of square feet of other primeManhattanreal estate.[74]Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico in Manhattan in 2002. It was re-opened with 35 stories of luxury condominiums in 2004 as theTrump Park Avenue.[75]Trump has owned a house on NorthRodeo Drivein theBeverly Hills, California/Los Angelesarea, bought for $7 million, since 2007. He bought a home next door in 2008 fromOmar Bongo, the president ofGabonwho would die in office in 2009, for $10.35 million. Trump sold the second LA home, built in 1981, for $9,500,095 in 2009 for an $850,000 (8%) loss. The second house went back on the market in mid-2016 listed at nearly $30 million.[76]Trump haslicensed his name and imagefor the development of a number of real estate projects including two Trump-branded real estate projects in Florida that have gone into foreclosure.[77]The Turkish owner ofTrump Towers Istanbul, who pays Trump for the use of his name, was reported in December 2015 to be exploring legal means to dissociate the property after the candidate\\'s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.[78]Trump also licensed his name to son-in-lawJared Kushner\\'s 50-storyTrump Bay Street, aJersey Cityluxury development that has raised $50\\xa0million of its $200\\xa0million capitalization largely from wealthyChinese nationalswho, after making an initial down payment of $500,000 in concert with the government\\'s expeditedEB-5 visaprogram, can usually obtain United States permanent residency for themselves and their families after two years.[79]Trump is a partner withKushner Propertiesonly in name licensing and not in the building\\'s financing.[79]In 2012, the 1290 Avenue of the Americas skyscraper in Manhattan wasrefinanced; Trump had a 30% stake in the building. The refinancing led to $211 million of debt being accrued with the state-ownedBank of China. This was the first instance of a Chinese bank engaging incommercial mortgage-backed securitiesin the United States. The Bank of China sold the debt in 2012 into the market, and thus no longer had \"any ownership interest in that loan\" thereafter, it stated. A 2017 document filed in New York City erroneously listed the Bank of China as a currentcreditordue to a mistake by loan servicer organizationWells Fargo.[80][81][82]Golf courses[edit]See also:Donald Trump and golfTurnberry HotelinSouth Ayrshire, ScotlandThe Trump Organization operates manygolf coursesand resorts in the United States and around the world. The number of golf courses that Trump owns or manages is about 18, according toGolfweek.[83]Trump\\'s personal financial disclosure with theFederal Elections Commissionstated that his golf and resort revenue for the year 2015 was roughly $382\\xa0million.[84][85]In 2006, Trump bought the Menie Estate inBalmedie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, creating a golf resort against the wishes of local residents[86]on an area designated as aSite of Special Scientific Interest.[87][88]A 2011 independent documentary,You\\'ve Been Trumped,by British filmmaker Anthony Baxter, chronicled the golf resort\\'s construction and the subsequent struggles between the locals and Donald Trump.[89]In December 2015, Trump\\'s appeal objecting to an offshore windfarm (Aberdeen Bay Wind Farm) within sight of the golf links was denied.[90]Despite Trump\\'s promises of 6,000 jobs, in 2016, by his own admission, the golf course has created only 200 jobs.[91]In June 2019,Scottish Natural Heritageruled that the golf course had \"destroyed\" the sand dune system, causing permanent habitat loss, and recommended that the SSSI status be revoked.[92]The special status was removed in December 2020.[93]In April 2014, Trump purchased theTurnberryhotel and golf resort inAyrshire, Scotland, which was a regular fixture inthe Open Championshiprota.[94][95]After the2021 United States Capitol attack, the organizer of the championship,The R&A, announced that The Open would not be held again at Turnberry as long as its links to the Trump Organization remained.[96][97]Professional sports[edit]See also:Donald Trump and American footballTrump delivers remarks at a press conference for theNew Jersey Generalsin 1985.President Donald J. Trump waves to the crowd during Game 5 of the MLB World Series between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros Sunday, Oct. 27, 2019, at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.In 1983, Trump\\'sNew Jersey Generalsbecame a charter member of the newUnited States Football League(USFL). Before the inaugural season began in 1983, Trump sold the franchise toOklahomaoil magnate J. Walter Duncan, and bought it back after the season. He then attempted to hire longtimeMiami DolphinscoachDon Shula, but the deal fell apart because he was unwilling to meet Shula\\'s demand for an apartment inTrump Tower. Trump ended up hiring formerNew York JetscoachWalt Michaels.[98][99][100]The USFL played its first three seasons during the spring and summer, but Trump convinced the majority of the owners of other USFL teams to move the USFL 1986 schedule to the fall, directly opposite theNational Football League(NFL), arguing that it would eventually force a merger with the NFL, which would supposedly increase their investment significantly.[101]Before the 1985 season, Trump signedHeisman Trophy-winning quarterbackDoug Flutieto a $7\\xa0million 5-year personal-services contract. That made Flutie the highest-paid pro football player at the time, as well as the highest-paidrookiein any professional sport.[102]After the season, the Generals merged with theHouston Gamblers. Trump owned 50% of the newly merged team, which would stay in New Jersey and retain the Generals nickname. At the time, Trump boasted \"it\\'s probably the best team in football.\" (New Jersey and Houston both had good but not great seasons in 1985: they each made the playoffs but lost first-round games.)The Generals never played another game.[103]The 1986 season was cancelled after the USFL won apyrrhic victoryin anantitrustlawsuit against the NFL: the NFL technically lost the suit, but the USFL was awarded just $3.00 in cash damages. The USFL, which was down to just 7 active franchises from a high of 18, folded soon afterward.[98]Trump had expressed an interest in purchasing theCleveland Indiansfor $13\\xa0million in a February 15, 1983 letter sent byKenneth Molloyto team presidentGabe Paul. Trump increased his offer to $34\\xa0million later that same year. His lack of commitment to keep the franchise inClevelandbeyond three years cost him any chance of completing the acquisition.[104]Trump remained involved with other sports after the Generals folded, operating golf courses in several countries.[98]He also hosted several boxing matches in Atlantic City at the Trump Plaza, includingMike Tyson\\'s 1988 fightagainstMichael Spinks, and at one time acted as a financial advisor forTyson.[98][105][106]In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to theTour de Trumpcycling stage racewhich was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as theTour de Franceor theGiro d\\'Italia. The name was suggested by his business partner, basketball commentatorBilly Packer, who originally planned to call the race the Tour deJersey. The first stage of the inaugural race ended in the college town ofNew Paltz, New Yorkwhere picketers greeted the riders with anti-Trump signs. The second stage began in New York City, andMayorEd Koch, who had denounced Trump as \"one of the great hucksters\", boycotted the event. The last stage of the 10-stage 837-mile race was even more controversial. Going into the last stage, Belgian riderEric Vanderaerdenwas favored to win the tour championship, but lost at least 1 minute 20 seconds when he took a wrong turn on a poorly marked course inAtlantic City, riding a quarter-mile or more out of his way. He ended up finishing third overall, behind tour winnerDag-Otto Lauritzen(a Norwegian rider with the American-owned7-Eleven team) and runner-upHenk Lubberding, who also took a wrong turn during the last stage. Trump withdrew his sponsorship after the second Tour de Trump in 1990 because his other business ventures were experiencing financial woes. The race continued for several more years as the Tour DuPont.[107][108]Trump submitted astalking-horse bidon theBuffalo Billswhen it came up for sale followingRalph Wilson\\'s death in 2014; he was ultimately outbid, as he expected, andKimandTerrence Pegulawon the auction.[109]During his 2016 presidential run, he was critical of the NFL\\'supdated concussion rules, complaining on the campaign trail that the game has been made \"soft\" and \"weak\", saying a concussion is just \"a ding on the head.\" He accused referees of throwingpenalty flagsneedlessly just to be seen on television \"so their wives see them at home.\"[110]In 2012, Scottish soccer clubRangerswas in financial turmoil, leading to itsliquidation and refounding. Trump considered buying the club, before backing out due to the extent of its financial issues.[111][112]Beauty pageants[edit]Further information:Miss USA,Miss Universe, andMiss Teen USAFrom 1996 until 2015, when he sold his interests,[113]Trump owned part or all of theMiss Universe,Miss USA, andMiss Teen USAbeauty pageants.Miss Universe debuted onCBS, and both Miss Universe and Miss USA moved toNBCin 2002.[114][115]In 2012, Trump won a $5\\xa0million arbitration award against a contestant who claimed the show was rigged.[116]In 2015, NBC andUnivisionboth ended their business relationships with the Miss Universe Organization during Trump\\'s presidential campaign .[117][118]Trump later announced that he had become the sole owner of the Miss Universe Organization by purchasing NBC\\'s stake.[119]He sold his own interests in the pageant shortly afterwards, toWME/IMG.[113]In 1999, a few years after buying into Miss Universe, Trump founded a modeling company,Trump Model Management, which operates in theSoHoneighborhood ofLower Manhattan.[120]Together with another Trump company, Trump Management Group LLC, Trump Model Management has brought hundreds of foreign fashion models into the United States to work in thefashion industrysince 2000.[121]This business and the beauty pageants overlapped somewhat, with various pageant contestants getting modelling contracts.[122]Trump University[edit]Main articles:Trump UniversityandCohen v. Trump (Trump University)Trump University LLC[123]was an Americanfor-profit educationcompany that ran a real estate training program from 2005 until at least 2010. After multiple lawsuits, it is now defunct. It was founded by Donald Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny.[124]The company offered courses in real estate, asset management, entrepreneurship, and wealth creation, charging between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[125]In 2005 the operation was notified by New York State authorities that its use of the word \"university\" violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the operation was changed to the \"Trump Entrepreneurial Institute\".[126]Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[127]In 2013 the state of New York filed a $40\\xa0million civil suit claiming that Trump University made false claims and defrauded consumers.[126][128]In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits relating to Trump University were filed in federal court; they named Donald Trump personally as well as his companies.[129]All three cases were settled in November 2016, after Trump\\'s election to the presidency, for a total of $25 million.[130]Trump repeatedly criticized a judge,Gonzalo P. Curiel, who is overseeing two of the Trump University cases. During campaign speeches and interviews up until June 2016, Trump called Curiel a \"hater of Donald Trump\", saying his rulings have been unfair, and that Curiel \"happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that\\'s fine\",[131]while suggesting that the judge\\'s ethnicity posed a conflict of interest in light of Trump\\'s proposal to build a wall on the United States–Mexican border.[132][133][134]Many legal experts were critical of Trump\\'s attacks on Curiel, often viewing them as racially charged, unfounded, and an affront to the concept of an independent judiciary.[135][136][137]On June 7, 2016, Trump issued a lengthy statement saying that his criticism of the judge had been \"misconstrued\" and that his concerns about Curiel\\'s impartiality were not based upon ethnicity alone, but also upon rulings in the case.[138][139]ACN, Inc.[edit]From 2005 to 2015, Trump was paid $8.8\\xa0million for promoting multi-level marketing telecommunications companyACN Inc.and its products on ACN\\'s website,[140]promotional DVDs and at their events, and on hisThe Apprenticereality-TV show.[141][142]In 2018, four investors filed a federal civil lawsuit in theSouthern District of New Yorkagainst Donald Trump and his children Donald Jr.,Ivanka, and Eric for fraud and racketeering. In July 2019, a  district judge permitted the lawsuit to proceed with state-level claims of fraud, false advertising, and unfair competition.[143][144][145]The Trumps were accused of not having disclosed that they were being paid by ACN when they recommended the company as a sound investment. As part of the discovery process, the Trumps were ordered in March 2020 to provide information from Trump Organization business records back to 2005.[146]In April 2020, a federal judge orderedMGM, the majority owner ofCelebrity Apprentice, to release unaired tapes of two episodes of the show to the attorneys of plaintiffs who accused the four Trumps of misleading them to invest in ACN; in the episodes, celebrity contestants competed to produce commercials for an ACN product.[147]The Trumps appealed the ruling and unsuccessfully sought to deal with the dispute viaarbitration.[148]In November 2021, a federal judge ordered MGM to make the tapes available to the plaintiffs\\' attorneys at a secure location.[147]Trump and his children were deposed in 2022.[149][150]In May 2023, the plaintiffs withdrew their claims against the children in order to \"to streamline the dispute ahead of a trial\".[151]The trial is scheduled for January 29, 2024.[152]Donald J. Trump Foundation[edit]Main article:Donald J. Trump FoundationThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a U.S.-basedprivate foundation[153]established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the bookTrump: The Art of the Dealby Trump andTony Schwartz.[154][155]The foundation\\'s funds mostly came from donors other than Trump,[156]whose last personal contribution to the charity was in 2008.[156]The top donors to the foundation from 2004 to 2014 wereVinceandLinda McMahonofWorld Wrestling Entertainment, who donated $5\\xa0million to the foundation after Trump appeared atWrestleManiain 2007.[156]Per the foundation\\'s tax returns, its benefactors included healthcare and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[157]In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to theArnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation($100,000), theNew York Presbyterian Hospital($125,000), thePolice Athletic League($156,000), and theClinton Foundation($100,000).[158][159]Starting in 2016The Washington Postbegan reporting on how the foundation raised and granted money. ThePostuncovered several potential legal and ethical violations, such as allegedself-dealingand possible tax evasion.[160]TheNew York State attorney generalis investigating the foundation \"to make sure it is complying with the laws governing charities in New York.\"[161][162]A Trump spokesman called the investigation a \"partisan hit job\".[161]On October 3, 2016, the New York attorney general\\'s office notified the Trump Foundation that it was in violation of New York laws regarding charities and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in the state of New York. The foundation, which had also admitted to engaging in self-dealing on its 2015 IRS form, agreed to this order.[163]A 2018 suit by the New York State attorney general alleged that Trump had illegally used foundation funds to buy self-portraits, pay off his businesses\\' legal obligations, and boost his presidential campaign. The judge ruled against the Donald J. Trump Foundation and ordered Trump to pay $2 million in damages. Trump agreed to give that money and the foundation\\'s remaining $1.8 million to 8 charities ranging from Army Emergency Relief to the United Negro College Fund to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and to dissolve the foundation.[164]Branding and licensing[edit]Further information:List of things named after Donald TrumpTheTrumplogo on a hotel in ChicagoTrump has marketed his name on a large number of building projects as well as commercial products and services, achieving mixed success doing so for himself, his partners, and investors in the projects.[165][166][nb 1]In 2011,Forbes\\'financial experts estimated the value of the Trumpbrandat $200\\xa0million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3\\xa0billion.[185]Many developers pay Trump to market their properties and to be the public face for their projects.[186]For that reason, Trump does not own many of the buildings that display his name.[186]According toForbes, this portion of Trump\\'s empire, actually run by his children, is by far his most valuable, having a $562\\xa0million valuation. According toForbes, there are 33 licensing projects under development including seven \"condo hotels\" (the seven Trump International Hotel and Tower developments). In June 2015,Forbespegged the Trump brand at $125\\xa0million[187]as retailers likeMacy\\'s Inc.andSerta Mattressesbegan dropping Trump-branded products.[188][189]The value of the Trump brand may have fallen due to his presidential campaign. After his 2016 campaign started, an internalYoung & Rubicamstudy of Trump\\'s brand among high-income consumers showed \"plummeting\" ratings for traits such as \"prestigious\", \"upper class\", and \"glamorous\" at the end of 2015, suggesting that Trump\\'s various businesses could face market difficulties and financing challenges in the future.[190]Some consumers say they are avoiding purchasing Trump-branded products and services as a protest against Trump and his campaign.[191]Bookings and foot traffic at Trump-branded hotels and casinos fell off sharply in 2016, primarily driven by a decrease in visits to the properties by women.[192][193]Following the release of theAccess Hollywoodtape recordingsin October 2016, the value of the Trump brand was reported to have taken a further hit, with estimates of the reduction in the brand\\'s added value of up to 13percentage points.[194][195]In March 2024, Trump began promoting the $60God Bless the U.S.A. Bible, which features a King James translation of the Bible; the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, and Pledge of Allegiance; as well as the handwritten chorus of theLee GreenwoodsongGod Bless the U.S.A.. The website selling the Bible bills it as \"the only Bible endorsed by\" Trump and that his \"name, likeness and image\" are being used under paid license from one of Trump\\'s organizations, CIC Ventures LLC.[196][197]Stocks, bonds, funds, and similar holdings[edit]Trump\\'s personal financial market investment portfolio is concentrated in the financial and commodities markets.[198][199]The investment portfolio generates income and cash flow from a variety of mechanisms as dividends, capital gains, and compounded carried interest. He invested a minimum of $70 million in stocks.[200]Though real estate is still his most preferred asset class, Trump became an active financial market investor in 2011 following disappointment from the depressed American real estate market and various investments in the Federal Reserve\\'s interest yields onCDswere next to nothing.[201][202]Trump stated that he was not enthusiastic to be a stock market investor, but that prime real estate at good prices was hard to find at that time and that stocks and equity securities were cheap and generating good cash flow from dividends.[203]He profited from 40 of the 45 stocks he purchased which he sold in 2014, making it almost a 90% success rate incapital appreciationin addition to millions in earned dividends. The biggest gainers in his stock portfolio were Bank of America Corporation,The Boeing Companyand Facebook, Inc earning a windfall profit of $6.7 million, $3.96 million and $3.85 million, respectively.[200]Trump\\'s stock portfolio was valued somewhere between $33.4 million and $87.9 million in 2015 and was invested in many sectors, including public companies such as tobacco distributors, retail outlets, pharmaceutical companies, industrial manufacturing companies, financial conglomerates, oil companies, high technology firms and defense contractors.[204]Public stock investments within his portfolio includeGeneral Electric,Chevron,UPS,Coca-Cola,Home Depot,Comcast,Sanofi,Ford,ConocoPhillips,Energy Transfer Partners,Altera,Verizon Communications,Procter & Gamble,Bank of America,Nike,Google,Apple Inc.,Philip Morris,Citigroup,Morgan Stanley,Whole Foods,Intel,IBM,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Johnson & Johnson,Caterpillar,Kinder Morgan,AT&Tand Facebook.[203][205][206]He has at least $78 million invested in a variety of paper assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, private equity funds, fund of funds, and hedge funds.[207]His financial market investment accounts are kept atJPMorgan,Barclays,Deutsche BankandOppenheimer.[205][208]His Barclays account includes investments in 32 entities and cash worth between $49,021 and $396,001 and having stock in two accounts atDeutsche Bankthat contain cash, treasury bills, and stock in 173 entities. His investment account with Oppenheimer contains cash and has 31positionsworth between $10,380,031 and $33,301,000. His account with JPMorgan contains stock in 60 firms valued between $1,251,008 and $2,617,000.[209]Trump has also invested in funds that focus on middle and smaller sized businesses such asTesla Motors, the electric car maker and has invested internationally in a number of emerging market, growth and hedge funds located in Europe and Asia.[210]He has also invested in a number of private equity and hedge funds including $1 to $5 million in Advantage Plus, $1 to $5 million in AG Diversified Funds, $2 million inMidOcean Credit Opportunities, $4 million inPaulson & Co., and around $5 million withAngelo, Gordon & Co.[211][212][213]Trump\\'s biggest fund holding has been inBlack Rock\\'s Obsidian Fund, where his stake is estimated to be between $25 million to $50 million.[214]Nearly all of Trump\\'s open end mutual fund investments are concentrated in Baron Capital Management, a mid-sized mutual fund family headed by mutual fund mogulRonald S. Baron.[210][215]Trump invested $16.2 million in Baron Capital Management, making him a significant minority shareholder.[202]He revealed that he earned over $22 million with his private equity, hedge fund, and mutual fund investments and generated between $1.5 million and $10 million in income almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest.[216]Trump also has a portion of his portfolio invested inU.S. Treasury bonds.[214]On a government form submitted in 2015, Trump reported holding an amount of physical gold, valued at between $100,001 to $250,000.[217]Taxes and income[edit]Main article:Tax returns of Donald TrumpSee also:Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016andWealth of Donald TrumpTrump released some financial information in 2015,[84]but declined to publicly release any of his full tax returns,[218]though he said he would do so before the 2016 election if what his attorneys described as an ongoingaudit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)was completed covering tax returns for the years 2009 through 2016.[219][220]According to a July 2015 press release from his campaign manager, Trump\\'s \"income\" for the year 2014 was $362\\xa0million (\"which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties\").[221]His disclosure filings for the year 2015 stated that his total gross revenue was in excess of $611\\xa0million.[84]Fortunemagazine has reported that the $362\\xa0million figure as stated on hisFederal Election Commission(FEC) filings is not \"income\" but gross revenue before salaries, interest payments on outstanding debt, and other business-related expenses; Trump\\'s net income was \"most likely\" about one-third of that.[222][223]According to public records, Trump received a $302 New York tax rebate in 2013 (and in two other recent years) given to couples earning less than $500,000 per year, who submit as proof their federal tax returns.[223]Trump\\'s campaign manager has suggested that Trump\\'s tax rebate was an error.[223]In October 2016, it was revealed that Trump had claimed a loss of $916 million on his 1995 tax returns. Astax lossesfrom one year can be applied to offset income from future years, the $916 million loss allowed him to reduce or eliminate his taxable income (and consequently his US federal income taxes) during the eighteen-year carry forward period.[224]Trump acknowledged he used the loss but declined to provide details such as the specific years the loss was applied.[225]An investigative story by theNew York Timesfound that in the early 1990s in order to avoid \"financial ruin\" Trump\\'s businesses used methods which were \"legally dubious\" to avoid paying taxes, and that Trump\\'s own lawyers described these activities as \"improper\".[226]Independent tax experts stated that \"Whatever loophole existed was not \\'exploited\\' here, but stretched beyond any recognition\" and that it involved \"sleight of hand\". Since the taxes were related to the reduction in Trump\\'s extensive junk bond debt at the time and the bankruptcies of three of Trump\\'s casinos, the methods used were probably related, according to the report, to Trump\\'s reported $916 million loss reported on his 1995 tax return.[227]See also[edit]Business projects of Donald Trump in RussiaDonald Trump pseudonymsMedia career of Donald TrumpNotes[edit]^His external entrepreneurial and investment ventures includeTrump Financial(a mortgage firm), Trump Sales and Leasing (residential sales), Trump International Realty (a residential and commercial real estate brokerage firm),The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative(a for profit business education company, formerly called theTrump University), Trump Restaurants (located in Trump Tower and consisting of Trump Buffet, Trump Catering, Trump Ice Cream Parlor, and Trump Bar), GoTrump (an online travel search engine[167][168][169]), Select By Trump (a line of coffee drinks),[170]Trump Drinks (an energy drink for the Israeli and Palestinian markets)[171][172][173][174]Donald J.

She is the firstnaturalized citizento become first lady, the second foreign-born first lady afterLouisa Adams, and the second Catholic first lady afterJacqueline Kennedy. As her husband was re-elected in the2024 presidential election, Melania is set to return to her role as first lady on January 20, 2025, following her husband\\'sinauguration. She will become the second first lady in history to serve two non-consecutive terms afterGrover Cleveland\\'s wifeFrances Cleveland.Melanija Knavs was born in Slovenia (then part ofYugoslavia) where she began working as a fashion model at the age of 16. She changed the spelling of her name toMelania Knauss, and she traveled toParisandMilanto seek modeling work before meetingPaolo Zampolli, who hired her and sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1996. She continued working as a model in Manhattan, where Zampolli introduced her to thereal estate developerDonald Trump in 1998. Melania and Donald began dating shortly afterward. He worked to get her more modeling jobs, and she supported him during his2000 presidential campaign. Melania and Donald Trump married in 2005, and they had a son,Barron Trump, the following year. She dedicated most of her time to Barron during his infancy, spending less time working or accompanying her husband at events. She started her own jewelry brand, Melania, in 2009.After encouraging Donald torun for presidentin the2016 presidential election, Melania only made rare campaign appearances, opting to help Donald strategize over the phone. She received major press coverage during the campaign when erotic photos from her modeling years were uncovered and published, and again when a speech she gave at the2016 Republican National Conventionwas found to be plagiarized from a similar speech byMichelle Obama. In the month leading up to the election, she defended her husband following the release of theAccess Hollywoodtapethat had caused a scandal for her husband.Melania stayed in Manhattan for the first months of her tenure as first lady, allowing Barron to finish school and Melania to renegotiate herprenuptial agreement. Her stepdaughterIvanka Trumpfulfilled some of the first lady\\'s traditional duties. She kept to minimal activity after moving into theWhite House, often staying in the residence instead of her office in theEast Wing, and she held fewer events than previous first ladies. Melania faced several challenges in 2018, includingallegations of extramarital affairsby her husband, surgery forkidney disease, and a tour of Africa that was overshadowed by scandals. During her tenure as first lady, Melania prioritized children\\'s issues, launching theBe Bestcampaign to promote children\\'s welfare and making many visits to children\\'s hospitals. She opposed her husband\\'sfamily separation policyand convinced him to end the practice. She was a close advisor to her husband. In the final months of her tenure, Melania endorsed her husband\\'sfalse claims of election fraudin the2020 presidential election, and has largely stayed out of public view since leaving the White House.Early life and educationMelanija Knavs was born inNovo Mesto, Yugoslavia, now part of present-daySlovenia, on April 26, 1970.[5][6]Her father Viktor Knavs first worked as a chauffeur, and he eventually sold car parts for a state-owned vehicle manufacturer as he made connections with theLeague of Communists of Yugoslavia, the national communist party.[7]Her motherAmalijaworked as apatternmakerat the children\\'s clothing manufacturer Jutranjka inSevnica.[5][8]In Sevnica, the family lived in the state-run housing complex Naselje Heroja Maroka.[9]She has an older sister, Ines,[10]and an older half-brother from her father\\'s previous relationship, Denis Cigelnjak, whom she reportedly has never met.[11]Her father denied paternity of the boy, even after it was confirmed by apaternity test.[12]Although Melanija\\'s father was a member of Yugoslavia\\'s communist party, which espoused a policy ofstate atheism,[13]he had his daughters secretlybaptizedasCatholic, as was common.[14][15]The family was well-off relative to most who lived in communist societies. They frequently went on vacations to other parts of Europe.[12]Their apartment was decorated with brightly colored walls, which was a major departure from other apartments in the country.[12][11]As a child, Melanija, like other children of workers at the factory participated in fashion shows that featured children\\'s clothing.[16][8][17]Textiles were Sevnica\\'s primary industry. Students were excused from school to participate in the shows.[18]From a young age, Melanija expressed an interest in fashion, and she began customizing and sewing her own clothes.[9]She developed a skill for it by watching her mother work.[19]Melanija did well in school, where she was appointed school treasurer.[20]When Melanija was a teenager, she moved to a two-story house in Sevnica with her family.[21]From her youth in Slovenia, Melanija was influenced by the United States: she described thepresidency of Ronald Reaganas the beginning of a new era in her own country and the debut ofCNN Internationalin 1985 gave her family access to American media.[22]Of particular interest to Melanija was the new exposure to global fashion.[19]At the age of fifteen, she began attending the Secondary School for Design and Photography inLjubljana, making the long commute from her hometown to the capital and back each day by train. After her first year, she and Ines moved to the capital together in an apartment paid for by their father.[23]After graduating at age nineteen, Melanija enrolled in the Faculty of Architecture and Civil and Geodetic Engineering at theUniversity of Ljubljanato further study design, leaving after a few months without finishing her degree.[24][25]Early modeling careerEuropean careerMelania was discovered by Slovenian fashion photographer Stane Jerko when she was sixteen, after modeling in a school-sponsored show.[26][27]At the time, she had wanted to be a fashion designer rather than a model.[12]Melania won a modeling contest with the Italian studioCinecittàthat entitled her to a movie role, but she rejected the prize after a producer sexually propositioned her.[28]As her modeling career progressed, Melania took on an alternate spelling of her name, Melania Knauss. She traveled Europe to find modeling work.[24][29]Except a few close relatives, she did not maintain contact with anyone she knew in Slovenia.[30]In 1992, Melania was namedrunner-upin theJana MagazineLook of the Yearcontest, which promised its top three contestants an international modeling contract.[5][24][12]She signed with RVR Reclame in Milan, but she left the organization a few months later.[31]Melania spent the following years traveling Europe for modeling jobs, including one in which she portrayed the first female president of the United States in 1993.[32]Around age 23 or 24, she made Paris her primary residence, where she lived with her roommateVictoria Silvstedt.[33]Melania modeled for fashion houses in Paris and Milan, where in 1995 she met Metropolitan Models co-ownerPaolo Zampolli, who was on a scouting trip in Europe. Zampolli, a friend of her future husbandDonald Trump,[17]became one of the few people who was involved in Melania\\'s life for a long time.[34]Relocating to New YorkZampolli urged Melania to travel to the United States, where he said he would like to represent her.[17]In 1996, Melania moved to Manhattan.[17][12]By this time, she was already 26 years old, much older than most aspiring models.[35]Zampolli encouraged Melania to live near and socialize with people in the fashion industry,[36]and he arranged for her to share an apartment with photographer Matthew Atanian inZeckendorf TowersinUnion Square.[37][17]Her rent was taken from her pay with Zampolli\\'s agency.[38]Once she resided in the United States, she returned to her home country only sparingly and only for short periods of time.[39]She lived a healthy lifestyle, managing her diet carefully,[40]and she avoided the drinking and partying that often consumed the lives of the models around her.[41]She did not lead an active social life and only went out on rare occasions.[41][40]Melania was featured in a sexually explicit photo shoot for a 1997 issue ofMax, a French men\\'s magazine, with another female model. The photos were shot by the photographer Alexandre Ale de Basseville, and the work was unpaid, instead promising Melania exposure in a prominent magazine. The photos were largely forgotten until they were published by theNew York Postin 2016.[42]For her first weeks in the United States, hertravel visadid not allow her to work in the country. Despite this, she accepted ten modeling jobs that earned her approximately $20,000 (equivalent to $39,000 in 2023). She then received anH-1B visathat allowed her to work.[36]She received her first major job when she posed for aCamel cigarettead shot byEllen von Unwerth, which was displayed as aTimes Squarebillboard and ran inRolling Stone. The opportunity came about from a law that required cigarette ads only feature individuals above the age of 25, which excluded most aspiring models.[43]When her roommate Atanian left New York, Melania moved to an apartment off ofPark Avenue.[44]Marriage and familyMeeting Donald TrumpDonald Trump and Melania Knauss in 1999In September 1998, Zampolli introduced Melania to the real estate mogul Donald Trump at a party.[45]Donald had a date to the event,Celina Midelfart. When he asked Melania for her phone number, she refused. Instead, she insisted that he give her his own number. He passed her test when he gave her multiple personal numbers instead of an office number.[46][47]She later said that giving her own number would make her \"just one of the women he calls\".[46]The exact details of when and where this took place are unclear, though the Kit Kat Club is often described as where they met.[48]After a week, Melania called Donald and they went on a date.[49]She intentionally gave him an indifferent attitude to his advances, knowing this would pique his interest.[50]Not only was Donald\\'s personality similar to that of Melania\\'s father,[16][51][52]but they were of similar ages and had similar physical appearances.[12][51][53]When they began dating, Melania had access to his bookTrump: The Art of the Comeback, in which he detailed what he wanted from a relationship.[54][55]Melania held a press conference on September 8, spending the event recounting her successes and telling reporters that she was \"world famous\", \"among the top 50\" highest paid models in the world, and set to appear in a movie alongsideMickey Rourke.[56]The intention was to build her profile in anticipation of another, ultimately unsuccessful, cigarette ad campaign.[57]This was unusual behavior for a woman who typically kept a quiet and professional presence,[58]and reporters were unable to verify the claims she made.[59]The Trumps have stated that they met at theNew York Fashion Weekshortly after this conference, but according to biographerMary Jordan, rumors in the industry suggested that their relationship had already developed by then.[58]Their relationship initially only lasted a few weeks. Melania left Donald after she saw his ex-girlfriendKara YoungleavingTrump Tower, but she reunited with him the following week.[60]Relationship with Donald TrumpDonald\\'s fame and connections gave her new career opportunities.[61]Shortly after the death ofJacqueline Kennedy, whom Melania and her mother had deeply admired, Melania met theKennedy familyat a gala.[62]She continued to encounter celebrities while attending events with Donald.[63]Melania continued her modeling career after meeting Donald,[17]though she took fewer jobs as time went on and she dedicated more time to him.[64]In 1999, the couple gained attention after an interview withshock jockHoward Sternon his show, in which he asked them lewd sexual questions.[65]Donald often brought Melania to meetings to show her off, praising her beauty. He did not let her participate in the business, citing the conflict he had with his first wife after giving her an executive role.[66]Melania Knauss withKylie Bax, Donald Trump, and then-presidentBill Clintonin 2000Donald announcedhis candidacyfor theReform Party presidential nominationon October 7, 1999. Melania adamantly supported the move.[67]When asked byThe New York Timeswhat her role would be if Donald were to become president, Melania replied: \"I would be very traditional, likeBetty Fordor Jackie Kennedy.\"[68]Melania saw extensive media attention astabloidsconsidered the idea of a model as first lady.[69]Melania was one of the first models recruited to Donald\\'s modeling agency,Trump Model Management, after its creation in February 1999. The following months, she appeared in several magazines and advertisements organized by individuals close to Donald.[70]While Donald was organizing his campaign, Melania appeared in the February edition ofSports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. The image featured her in a bikini alongside a large inflatable whale, and the shoot was run byAntoine Verglas, an associate of Zampolli\\'s.[71]Shortly after the shoot, Verglas called Melania back for another project where he had her pose nude in aBond girlaesthetic.[72]Melania later said that she stood \\'proudly behind [her] nude modeling work\\' in a post on X in September of 2024.[73]Donald had lobbied for her inclusion in aGQspread,[74]and her relationship with Donald allowed the shoot access to hisBoeing 727. Images from the shoot were featured in the January 2000 edition ofGQmagazine.[72]At the time, Donald\\'s involvement was not made known.[36]She then appeared in another sexualized photo shoot where she was posted in a mock-up of theOval Office.[75]In January 2000, news broke that Melania and Donald had broken up, with conflicting accounts of who ended the relationship. Many photos and publicity pieces the two had done together were quickly edited before publication to accommodate the change.[76]They kept in contact, and they reunited a few months later.[77]Melania received hergreen cardin 2001, granting herpermanent residencyin the United States.[36][5]Melania and Donald moved in together at Trump Tower in 2002.[78]She made her first appearance on Donald\\'s game showThe Apprenticein April 2004 when an episode had the contestants visit their penthouse.[79]Engagement and weddingDonald proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, on her birthday as they were leaving to attend theMet Gala.[80]He reasoned that he was more willing to wed as she had not insisted on marriage, and he felt she was an influence in the success he had seen over the previous years.[81]She also signed hisprenuptial agreementwithout issue.[82]A few months before the wedding, Melania traveled to Paris withAnna WintourandAndré Leon Talleyto find a wedding dress, and Melania decided on a dress byJohn Galliano.[83]In the days leading up to the wedding, she appeared on the front cover ofVoguein her dress.[84][85]Donald and Melania married on January 22, 2005, at theBethesda-by-the-Seachurch inPalm Beach, Florida.[86]The ceremony was followed by a reception in theballroomat Donald\\'sMar-a-Lagoestate, which Melania planned with Preston Bailey.[87]Numerous celebrities were present, including musicians, athletes, media executives, and television personalities.[88]She had onebridesmaid, her sister Ines, who had moved to New York so they could be closer together.[39]Melania arranged all of the details of the wedding with her planner. She let Donald make decisions about the event, but she refused his suggestion that the wedding be broadcast onNBC.[89]Marriage and motherhoodDonald Trump and Melania Trump in 2006The Trumps hadthree residencesthat they traveled between: Trump Tower in New York,Trump National Golf Club Bedminsterin New Jersey, and Mar-a-Lago in Florida.[39][90]To have her own private abode, Melania had a private spa constructed on the top floor of Trump Tower.[90]As a couple, the two did not spend much direct time together, preferring to live adjacently with one another.[91]According to Donald, their passive relationship suited him because he worked for a living and did not \"want to go home and work at a relationship\".[12][92]Melania accepted a transaction element in their relationship, though she cared about Donald and did not believe that she was agold digger.[93]When she attended events with her husband at Trump facilities, she often stayed for only a few minutes to make an appearance before returning to the private residence.[94]Donald did not learn to speak Melania\\'s native language, which she said she accepted because she is \"not a nagging wife\".[5]Upon marrying Donald, Melania became stepmother to his four children:Donald Trump Jr.,Eric TrumpandIvanka Trumpfrom his first marriage toIvana Zelníčková, andTiffany Trumpfrom his second marriage toMarla Maples.[95]Melania had especially bonded with Tiffany, who was six when Melania began dating Tiffany\\'s father, and made sure she felt included among her step-siblings.[96]When Melania herself became pregnant, it was widely covered in the media.[97]This included her second appearance on the cover ofVogue, featuring her pregnant body in a bikini and an open coat.[98]Melania spent the months with her sister and her parents, who visited throughout the pregnancy. She also oversaw the construction of a nursery in Trump Tower.[99]She had ababy showerat theFAO Schwarztoy store, but she insisted that the toys and gifts she received be donated to a children\\'s hospital.[100]On March 20, 2006, Melania and Donald had a son,Barron William Trump.[101]Melania chose her son\\'s middle name, while Donald chose his first name.[102]Donald had previously used the name Barron as apseudonymfor when he posed as his own public relations agent.[103]After Barron was born, Melania was active in his life and accordingly spent less time attending events with her husband.[104][105]Donald had made it clear to her that if they had a child, he would not be actively involved in the child\\'s life.[105]Melania later said she approved of this, stating that she \"didn\\'t want him changing diapers or putting Barron to bed\".[12]She avoided the use of nannies, with a few exceptions in Barron\\'s earliest years, insisting on raising him herself.[106]This lessened social activity meant that Donald began courting supermodels again, which made Melania uncomfortable. According to biographer Mary Jordan, Melania did not know about the women who later alleged that they had extramarital affairs with him.[90]Melania stayed out of the public spotlight after she settled into her life as a Trump, excepting occasional charity work and an appearance in anAflaccommercial.[107]She became a citizen of the United States on July 28, 2006.[108]She then sponsored her parents using the \"chain migration\" immigration process that her husband later repeatedly criticized.[109][110]Melania and Barron maintaindual citizenship, both in the United States and Slovenia[111]Spending most of her time at Trump residences, she rarely kept companions besides her parents and her son.[94]Business venturesAs her son reached childhood, Melania found herself with more time for other pursuits.[112]She trademarked her name, Melania, in 2009 as a jewelry brand, which she used to sell less expensive jewelry pieces onQVC.[113]She was intentional about not using the Trump name in her branding, correcting reporters who called it Melania Trump.[114]She drew the designs herself,[12]which were based on three places where she had lived: New York, Palm Beach, and Paris. Over the following years, she released additionalMelaniacollections, and they sold out each time.[114]Melania Trump in 2011Melania then developed a line ofcaviar-infused skincare products under the brand Melania Marks Skincare in 2011.[115]The brand never launched. It brought about a legal case when the company selling the products, New Sunshine, underwent management changes and voided the contract. The company alleged that one executive had given asweetheart dealto the Trumps because he was a family friend. The case was decided in Melania\\'s favor, and the amount to be paid to her was settled out of court.[116]She had initially sued the company for $50 million in lost revenue.[117]Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaignPersonal life during the campaignMelania was the one who finally convinced Donaldto campaign for presidentin the2016 presidential election, telling him that he either needed to do it or stop talking about it.[118][119]When the campaign began, Melania made it clear to her husband that she would not be pressured into campaigning or attending events, and that she would only make appearances when she wanted to. She subsequently played a relatively small role in the campaign, which had been atypical of spouses of presidential candidates since the early 20th century.[120]Explaining her absence, she cited the need to stay home with her son Barron.[121][122]Her daily routine was nonetheless altered by the campaign, as she had to take security arrangements into account when she traveled, and she could not post about her activities online in real time.[123]Once a prolific user ofInstagramandTwitter, she became less active on her social media accounts when the campaign began.[12]While many people doubted Donald\\'s chances at the presidency, including his own inner circle, Melania believed he would win.[124][125]Unlike Donald\\'s advisors, Melania encouraged him to follow his instincts and say what he felt he should say, with the exception that she does not like his use of profane language.[126]She analyzed the campaign closely from home, following polling and watching how her husband interacted with his opponents.[127]She spoke to him on the phone regularly throughout the campaign, including a conversation after each rally in which she gave a candid evaluation of how he did.[128]Campaign involvementMelania Trump at a campaign event with Donald and Barron in November 2015Melania\\'s career as a model was an advantage during the campaign, as she was prepared for photographers and did not need to hire a fashion consultant.[24]As a model, she was required to be deliberate in all of her movement, including how she stood and walked.[129]She resented being called shy during the campaign, saying that this was an impression spread by people who only briefly met her and wanted their \"15 minutes of fame\".[130]Melania\\'s earliest speaking appearances in November 2015 and February 2016 were prompted by Donald calling on her to speak to the crowd. Both times, she only said a few sentences.[131]Her first scheduled speech during the campaign did not take place until April 2016.[122]The campaign reportedly wanted to get Melania more active, as she was in a unique position to humanize Donald and to appeal to theAmerican Dreamfrom an immigrant\\'s perspective.[132]Hope Hickswas the campaign\\'s main liaison with Melania, facilitating any appearances that she wished to make. Melania trusted Hicks\\'s judgement and allowed her to weigh the importance of a given appearance.[133]Her rare appearances brought her toswing stateswhere her husband needed extra support, and her speeches celebrated his personal traits instead of policy.[121]Melania was involved in thevice presidential selection process, meeting with the top contenders, and her approval ofMike Pencecontributed to his selection. The deciding factor, in her mind, was that Pence was not as ambitious as the other contenders and would not seek to undermine Donald.[134]Media coverageMelania Trump in 2016Anattack adagainst the Trumps was produced by asuper PACthat supported Donald\\'s opponentTed Cruzfeaturing Melania\\'s nudeGQphoto with the caption \"Meet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday\", intensifying the rivalry between the two candidates in the2016 Republican Party presidential primaries.[121][135][12]More nude images of Melania were published on the front page of theNew York Postin July 2016 in a story titled \"The Ogle Office\". The images did not have a major effect on the campaign, as Melania was seen as the victim, but they were humiliating and she spent the following two months away from the public.[136]On July 18, 2016, Melania gavea speechat the2016 Republican National Convention. A controversy emerged after it became apparent that a paragraph of the speech had been plagiarized fromMichelle Obama\\'s speech at the2008 Democratic National Convention.[137][138]When asked about it, Melania said she wrote the speech herself \"with as little help as possible\".[139]Despite political campaigns typically having several people to scrutinize such speeches, no one in the Trump campaign had reviewed the speech.[140]Donald was furious with his staff and felt he had failed Melania, while Melania felt she herself had failed the campaign through the scandal.[141]It was the only major speech she delivered during the campaign.[142]Two days later, Trump staff writerMeredith McIvertook responsibility, saying there was a misunderstanding when Melania read passages of Obama\\'s speech as examples.[137][143]The speech also included a rare statement on her past, describing her family in Slovenia and her early modeling career.[140]After giving the speech, Melania stayed out of public view until election day approached.[144]Access Hollywood tapeOn October 7, a month before the election, theAccess Hollywood tapewas leaked. The tape had been recorded in 2005, shortly after their marriage, and it featured audio of Donald making controversial remarks about his treatment of women. Immediately after its release, the campaign\\'s primary concern was Melania\\'s reaction. It took Donald two hours before he went to see Melania. Upon their meeting, Melania reportedly told him \"Now you could lose, you could have blown this for us\", and then left the room after he apologized.[145]In 2024, her husband\\'s former personal counselMichael Cohentestified duringThe People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trumptrial that Donald had privately credited her as having suggested that the campaign\\'s response strategy should best characterize the conversation on the tape as\"locker room talk\".[146]Melania kept her distance from him, angry that he may have ended his candidacy with his comments, and she waited a day before making a comment.[147]When asked by the campaign to make a scripted appearance alongside Donald as damage control, she refused, deciding that she was going to respond her own way.[148]She also refused to sit beside him during his recorded apology as politicians\\' spouses often did in these situations.[149]Melania released a statement saying that the tape did not show \"the man I know\" and said those whoaccused him of sexual misconductare liars.[137]Melania received significantly more attention from the press following the incident,[150]and she was frustrated by the pity she received.[148]A few days later, she attended apresidential debatewearing apussy bow, causing widespread speculation about her intention (as her husband\\'s comments on the Access Hollywood tape had included, \"grab them by thepussy\"–with pussy beingslangforvagina).[151][150]After she voted, Melania spent most of election day with her parents in Trump Tower while the rest of the family did last minute campaigning.[152]First lady of the United States (2017–2021)First lady in ManhattanMelania Trump with Donald Trump at the Liberty Ball, January 20, 2017AfterDonald\\'s inaugurationas president on January 20, 2017,[153]Melania announced that she would not move toWashington, D.C.with him, instead staying in Manhattan so Barron could finish the school year there.[154]This also allowed her to introduce her son to theWhite Housegradually so as not to overwhelm him.[155]During this time, Melania negotiated new terms for her prenuptial agreement with Donald to reflect the changes in their lives since it was signed and to ensure that Barron received a suitable inheritance.[156]Melania was the second foreign-born woman to hold the title of first lady afterLouisa Adams, who was born in England,[153]and Melania was the firstnaturalized citizento hold the title.[157]She has said that she can speak English, Italian, French, and German in addition to her native Slovene, but in public she has only spoken English and Slovene.[158]She was also the secondCatholicfirst lady of the United States, after Jacqueline Kennedy.[159][160]Melania\\'s absence from the White House caused speculation that her stepdaughter Ivanka would serve as an acting first lady.[154][161][162]As time went by, members of the administration\\'s staff like her assistant,Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, grew unhappy with Melania\\'s absence, as it gave the impression of marital issues and prevented her from exercising a calming influence over the president.[163][164]She also stoked resentment among many of the people in New York, who predominantly opposed the Trumps, because of the costs and traffic issues caused by theSecret Servicepresence.[165][166]The Secret Service itself also faced logistical issues from the repeated travel to New York. Having a Secret Service detail was not a major adjustment for Melania though, as she had spent years around her husband\\'s security team.[167]She was given theSecret Service code name\"Muse\" to go along with the president\\'s name \"Mogul\".[168]Being first lady came with another drawback for Melania, as she was expected to speak on serious topics such as immigration policy and had little control over how her media appearances were handled, which was a different experience than she had as a model.[169]Melania Trump with Pope Francis, the Vatican, May 2017When the Trump administration\\'sWhite House websitewas posted, Melania\\'s biographical information caused controversy because it listed her jewelry business. Though it had already ceased operation, critics alleged that it was an attempt to promote her business with government resources.[170]Another allegation of attempting to profit from her role as first lady came up in February, when she sued theDaily Mailfor libel after it alleged in 2016 that she had worked for anescort agency.[171]The suit was initially for lost career opportunities, but this was changed to emotional distress when she received questions about why she expected to have career opportunities as first lady.[172]On March 8, 2017, Melania hosted her first White House event, a luncheon forInternational Women\\'s Day. She spoke to an audience of women about her life as a female immigrant and about working towardsgender equalityboth domestically and abroad, noting the role of education as a tool againstgender inequality.[173][174]The Trumps visitedVatican Cityin May 2017. As Melania was visiting as a Catholic,Pope Francisblessed her rosary beads, and she placed flowers at the feet of a statue of theMadonnaat the Vatican\\'sBambino Gesùchildren\\'s hospital.[175]The first major public attention Melania received was after an incident in May 2017 while the Trumps were visiting Israel. Donald had forgotten that Melania was by his side when he was walking with Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu, and she fell behind from the group. Humiliated, she slapped away his hand when he reached out behind him to grab hers. This was the first time press coverage of Melania took notice of an independent streak.[176][177]East Wing staffThe lack of staff appointments in theEast Wingduring the first months of the Trump administration—typically the domain of the first lady—caused a backlog of tour requests to develop. In February several hires were made for theOffice of the First Lady:Anna Cristina Niceta Lloydas social secretary,Lindsay Reynoldsas the first lady\\'s chief of staff, Tham Kannalikham as her decorator, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff as the first lady\\'s assistant, andStephanie Grishamas communications director.[178]Melania retained the head florist appointed by Michelle Obama, Hedieh Ghaffarian.[179]Thechief usherappointed under theObama administration,Angella Reid, was replaced byTrump International HotelemployeeTimothy Harleth, breaking the norm of the chief usher serving under multiple presidencies.[178]Reid had been broadly unpopular with the staff, and the firing earned Melania their goodwill.[180]The first lady\\'s staff remained small relative to those of her predecessors.[178]This was in part because she did not want to have any employees speaking on her behalf. Instead, she answered her correspondences herself.[181]Melania had a reputation in the White House for being \"drama-free\",[182]and for treating the staff well.[183]According to her husband\\'s campaign managerCorey Lewandowski, her staff had \"100 percent loyalty to her\".[184]Melania had a close, trusting relationship with her staff, and she was protective of them when conflict arose.[185]Before moving in, Melania worked with Kannalikham to redecorate the White House, as first ladies typically do. She had most of the Obama-era decor replaced, and like the Obamas, the Trumps paid for it out of pocket instead of using the allotted funding.[186]Life in the White HouseMelania Trump with Argentine first ladyJuliana Awadain 2017Melania and her son, Barron, moved into the White House on June 11, 2017.[187]Like they had throughout their marriage, Melania and Donald chose to sleep in separate bedrooms.[188]In her first year, Melania gave only eight speeches, compared to 74 by Michelle Obama and 42 byLaura Bush.[189]Instead of frequent public appearances, she communicated her activities through video.[184]Most of Melania\\'s appearances as first lady in 2017 were in Manhattan and Washington, and she typically spoke about women\\'s and children\\'s issues.[190]After moving to the White House, Melania opted to spend most of her time in the private quarters, running the White House staff from there instead of the first lady\\'s East Wing offices. She oversaw restorations of several rooms in the building, including the bowling alley in theWhite House basementand the first lady\\'s hairdresser\\'s room.[191]She kept one office, called the \"swag room\" by aides, in which she kept trinkets she collected while she was first lady.[192]To accommodate Barron\\'s soccer practice, she had a net installed on the White House grounds and had a coach practice with him.[193]Barron remained Melania\\'s top priority when she was first lady, and she worked to keep him free from politics to the point that staffers referred to her as \"The Protector\".[194]Even after arriving at the White House, Melania spent extensive time away each year, visiting Mar-a-Lago on major holidays and over many weekends.[195]Melania Trump examining the 2018 White House Christmas decorationsMelania personally involved herself in decorations and planning within the White House.[196]She was particular about how things were designed and arranged whenever events were planned, but she would take on a calm and relaxed demeanor once the event began.[197]Whenever a foreign dignitary arrived at the White House, Melania had theBlue Roomset aside where she ate lunch or drank tea with the dignitary\\'s spouse.[198]When choosing whichpresidential china setto use, Melania often chose theClinton administrationchina with its gold embroidery.[199]She held events less frequently than her predecessors, with a typical week featuring three or fewer events, all under one hour long.[200]Among her most ambitious projects was planning the White House Christmas decorations in 2018. Moving away from traditional designs, she filled the East Collonnade with red cranberry-laden trees set atop a green carpet. The design was widely derided, which Melania ascribed to personal taste.[201]To protect use of her image and maintain an income, Melania licensed photos from her photoshoots throughGetty Images. This allowed her to choose how they were used by reporters, and she received royalties for each use. TheOffice of Government Ethicsreported that she made $100,000 to $1,000,000 in royalties in 2017, though other estimates put it at over $10,000,000.[202]As one of her official duties, Melania was the honorary chair of theJohn F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Because of political tension with the arts communities, she was not initially active in the role. She made her first appearances at the Kennedy Center in 2019.[203]Tribulations in early 2018A scandal broke in January 2018 when it was alleged that Donald hadhad an extramarital affairwith the pornographic actressStormy Daniels. The affair was said to have taken place in July 2006, after the Trumps\\' marriage and the birth of their son. Melania\\'s public appearances became more infrequent after the news emerged, and she canceled several events that she was to attend with her husband.[204]This included the2018 State of the Union Address, where Melania made the unprecedented decision to ride separately from him on the way there.[205]Michael Cohen, who had arranged the silencing of the alleged affair, stated that his greatest regret was lying to Melania, saying that she didn\\'t deserve it.[206]The next month, the story of a second affair in 2006 with the modelKaren McDougalwas made public.[204][207]To Melania, the worst part was that she felt Donald had publicly humiliated her.[208][164]Left to right:Brigitte Macron, Melania Trump,Emmanuel Macron,Donald TrumpMelania learned in April 2018 that she was afflicted with kidney disease, but she only told her parents, her husband, and her sister.[209]On May 14, she began treatment atWalter Reed National Military Medical Center.[210]While her husband had wished to join her, his presence would have risked the press discovering her condition.[211]The official statement said that she underwent anembolization, aminimally invasive procedurethat deliberately blocks a blood vessel.[212][212]A statement was released after the procedure was finished without complication,[210]and she recovered in the hospital over the following five days.[213]The extended stay led to false rumors and conspiracy theories that she had gottenplastic surgery.[214][215]After leaving the hospital, she continued to stay out of the public eye until the beginning of June.[216]At this point, the president let slip that the surgery had been more serious than initially suggested.[217]Those around Melania noticed that she was generally happier by mid-2018. By this time, she had reached a more advantageous marital agreement that ensured Barron would be given a fair inheritance.[218]Her public position, and the corresponding influence she had over her husband\\'s political career, had given her the advantage in negotiations.[219]After several months of problems, Melania received positive coverage for a large custom-made white hat that she wore during a visit by French presidentEmmanuel Macron.[220]On August 9, 2018, Melania\\'s parents were granted American citizenship. This revitalized accusations of hypocrisy by the Trumps regarding Melania\\'s parents, as Donald had spoken out against the chain migration process that allowed them to enter the United States.[221]2018 Africa tourMelania Trump wearing apith helmetin KenyaIn October 2018, Melania took a tour of Africa without Donald, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt. She spent much of her time with children in schools, orphanages, and hospitals. She used the trip to tout relief work being carried out by theUnited States Agency for International Development, which raised questions about her husband\\'s intention to cut its funding. Melania also received criticism for her fashion choices, where a photo opportunity in front of theGreat Sphinx of Gizawas seen as exploitive and apith helmetshe wore in Kenya was criticized for its association withcolonialism in Africa. To these criticisms, she responded that people should pay more attention to her actions instead of her outfits.[222]Perception of the trip grew worse when she responded to criticisms by saying that she was \"the most bullied person in the world\".[223]Throughout Melania\\'s tour of Africa, personality conflicts took place between her team andMira Ricardel, theDeputy National Security Advisor.[224]Ricardel\\'s staffer had been bumped from the first lady\\'s plane on the flight to Africa to make room for a journalist, and Ricardel subsequently became less cooperative with providing logistical information needed for the tour.[225]Upon returning, Ricardel gave a thoroughly negative report on Melania\\'s staff, describing them as embarrassing the White House with their partying.[226]Melania twice complained to the president, but no immediate action was taken.[226]So the following month, the Office of the First Lady issued an official statement calling for Ricardel to be removed from her position. Publicly commenting on such a thing was unprecedented for a first lady.[227]No one in the administration had been told in advance about the statement, including the president.[226]Ricardel was fired the following day.[228]A dispute over the trip arose between Melania and Ivanka a few months later when the latter made her own trip to the continent. Melania felt that in taking such a similar trip, Ivanka was intruding on the first lady\\'s role.[229]Political influenceMelania Trump working with children at a 2017 Christmas event; children\\'s welfare was among the most important issues to Melania.Melania was the one person exempt from the criticism and distrust that Donald leveled against those around him in the White House. He held her opinion in high regard, often agreeing with her when she made it known, and he valued her loyalty as she did not seek public attention of her own.[230]Melania believed that it was not her duty as first lady to take policy positions in her own right, but simply to advise Donald regarding his.[12]She was the only person among those around him who could critique him directly without repercussion.[231]Donald frequently asked for her opinion about issues he was considering or people who he interacted with, calling her over the phone when she was not in the same room.[232]Melania paid close attention to media coverage throughout Donald\\'s presidency, providing her input on what would make good optics and maintain his image.[233][234]She also provided advice on how to pose for pictures and has given him suggestions on how to appear when moving.[235]The nature of their relationship allowed Melania to overlook erratic behavior from Donald, as she had long believed that there was no use in trying to change someone\\'s personality, especially her husband\\'s.[181]Melania had influence over her husband\\'s staff, and Donald sometimes fired individuals on her advice.[187][236]The welfare of children is a subject of interest for her, and she routinely made visits to children\\'s hospitals throughout her tenure as first lady.[237]According to her biographer Kate Bennett, interacting with children is one of the rare things that causes Melania to shift away from her usual stoic demeanor.[238]Her advocacy was a major factor in her husband\\'s decision to ban fruit flavoredelectronic cigarettes.[239]About one year into her tenure, Melania hired Reagan Thompson as a policy advisor, though she had yet to adopt any official initiatives at the time.[240]Family separation policyMelania was openly critical of her husband\\'s\"zero tolerance\" policy of denying asylumat theMexico–United States borderin 2018, where children were being separated from their parents. Her official position was that she hated to see families separated and hoped for successful immigration reform.[241][242]Out of public view, she made her opposition clear to the president and influenced his decision to end it.[243]Leaked tapes in 2020 featured Melania making statements defending some of the practices, expressing grief about family separation but questioning the validity ofasylum claimsand dismissing concerns that children were kept in substandard conditions.[244]Melania was upset when her stepdaughter Ivanka began receiving the credit for changing the president\\'s mind on the issue.[245]Melania decided to visit the border herself, ignoring her husband\\'s worries about keeping media attention on the border and the Secret Service\\'s need of advance notice to plan her trip.[246]She arrived at the border on June 21, where she visited the family separation facilities in Texas and attended aroundtablewith doctors, medical staff, social workers, and other experts at Upbring New Hope Children\\'s Shelter.[247]On the way to the border facility, she caused controversy by wearing a jacket that read, \"I really don\\'t care, do u?\" After much speculation about the jacket\\'s message, including criticism that she may have been expressing indifference toward the families separated at the border, Melania stated that the jacket was aimed at people and media who were criticizing her.[248]The jacket dominated media coverage of her visit.[249]Be Best campaignMain article:Be BestMelania Trump celebrating the second anniversary of the Be Best campaignOn May 7, 2018, Melania held a press conference in theWhite House Rose Gardento announce her official public initiative as first lady, the Be Best awareness campaign. The initiative was created to support the welfare of children, advocate againstcyberbullying, and preventopioid abuse.[213][250]The initiative\\'s name drew ridicule in the press for its grammatical structure.[251]Instead of creating new programs like previous first ladies\\' projects, Be Best promoted existing initiatives and organizations that worked toward the cause. Public awareness of the initiative remained low, and it was often regarded solely as an anti-cyberbullying campaign.[252]The Be Best campaign drew criticism for its perceived hypocrisy, challenging cyberbullying when her husband was well known for attacking people online.[253][252]Even Donald had warned her before the campaign\\'s launch that the contrast may provoke criticism.[252]She acknowledged the discrepancy but insisted that she would continue because she felt it was a good cause.[253]This received more attention in 2019 when the president made Twitter posts critical ofGreta Thunberg, a teenage environmental activist diagnosed on theautism spectrum. This came days after Melania had criticizedPamela Karlanfor invoking Barron in a speech against the president. The first lady\\'s office responded that spouses can have different communication styles, and said that Barron was not \"an activist who travels the globe giving speeches\".[254]COVID-19 and 2020 presidential campaignMelania Trump with first responders during theCOVID-19 pandemicMelania carried out a major reorganization of her staff in April 2020 in anticipation ofher husband\\'s reelection campaign. She appointed Marcia Lee Kelly as her senior advisor andEmma Doyleas her policy advisor. Melania\\'s chief of staff, Lindsay Reynolds, was removed; her responsibilities went to Melania\\'s communications director, Stephanie Grisham.[184]Melania became an active campaigner for her husband during the2020 presidential election, which was a strong contrast to her 2016 activity.[255]When theCOVID-19 pandemicbegan, Melania was criticized for promoting a White House renovation project. She took the topic more seriously after theCOVID-19 lockdownsbegan, using her Twitter account to encouragesocial distancing during the pandemicand promote official medical advice. Much of what she posted directly contradicted what her husband posted, as he discouraged many of the recommended practices.[256][257]On October 1, 2020, Melania\\'s former advisor Stephanie Winston Wolkoff released audiotapes that featured Melania making profane statements about her image and role as first lady. In the tapes, she condemned the media for not giving her positive coverage, questioned why people wanted her to speak out against her husband when she supported his policies, and expressed frustration with her responsibility to oversee Christmas decorations in the White House. She also mentioned her \"I really don\\'t care, do u\" jacket in the tapes, admitting that she wore it to irritateliberals. Winston Wolkoff had released the tapes alongside atell-allbook,Melania and Me.[244][258]The Justice Department filed acivil suitagainst Winston Wolkoff in October 2019, alleging breach of anondisclosure agreement, but it was dropped in February 2021 under the Biden administration.[259]In September 2022, Melania said in an interview withBreitbart Newsthat the audiotapes had been strategically edited to make people believe that her duties in the White House had been unimportant to her.[260]Despite Donald\\'s loss of the 2020 election,[261]Melania ended her tenure by endorsing his false statement that he had been the legitimate election winner.[192][223]For her final months in the White House, she stopped visiting her office in the East Wing and remained in the White House residence. Her focus at this time was on compiling photo albums of the decorations and renovations she had overseen through her tenure.[192]Melania was managing photography at the White House when theJanuary 6 United States Capitol attacktook place and gave no comment at the time. She later said that she would have commented if she had been \"fully informed of all the details\".[164]Her communications director Stephanie Grisham later stated she had sent Melania a text message asking her to make a statement condemning the violence and resigned when that did not happen.[192]On January 18, Melania released a farewell video asking the American people to uphold the principles of her Be Best campaign.[223]She did not contact incoming first ladyJill Bidento make transition arrangements or provide her the traditional tour of the White House.[223]She did, however, follow the tradition of leaving a letter for the incoming first lady.[192]As her husband, Donald Trump, was elected to the presidency for a second, non-consecutive term on November 5, 2024, Trump will return to her role as First Lady in January 2025.[262]After the White House (2021–present)After the Trumps left the White House, Melania returned to Mar-a-Lago, where she could live while avoiding public attention.[164]She retained one White House advisor, Marcia Lee Kelly, to help her during the post-presidency.[223]Melania kept in contact with her successor Jill Biden, and the two have exchanged birthday cards.[192]Since her tenure as first lady ended, Melania has made occasional paid speaking appearances, she has founded a scholarship program forfoster children, and she has minted a line ofApollo 11–themednon-fungible tokensthat were not in compliance withNASA\\'s image use policy.[164]In November 2023, Melania attended the memorial service for former First LadyRosalynn Carter.[263]Melania remained out of public view during her husband\\'scourt appearancesandhis candidacyin the2024 presidential election, limiting her campaign events to two fundraisers for theLog Cabin Republicans. She became more visible in July 2024 by putting out a statement following theattempted assassination of her husbandand appearing at the2024 Republican National Convention, though she declined an invitation to speak at the event, making her the first candidate\\'s spouse not to speak at the convention sinceBarbara Bushbegan the tradition.[264]In the same month, Melania announced her intention to publish amemoir, titledMelania.[265]She caused controversy among Republicans in the lead up to the book\\'s publication when she announced her support for theright to abortion.[266]Donald was reelected president in November 2024. Uponhis second inauguration, Melania will become the second first lady to hold the position two times non-consecutively, afterFrances Cleveland.[267]Public imageMain article:Public image of Melania TrumpA2017 Women\\'s Marchprotester with a Free Melania signMelania limits her interactions with the public, creating a public image heavily influenced by speculation.[268]She worked to protect her privacy as first lady,[269]and her staff was instructed not to answer any questions about her whereabouts at a given time.[182]With limited information, commentators have portrayed her as being a reluctant companion to her husband or as a woman who has no independence of her own. Several incidents during her husband\\'s presidency led to rumors that she had a secret animosity toward her husband, such as her delay in moving to the White House and allegations that he had committed adultery.[214][269][270]The rumors led to popular use of thehashtag#FreeMelania by those who believed them.[271]Though she disliked the idea that people saw her as helpless, Melania found the campaign amusing.[272]This became less common by 2020 as she had become more publicly associated with the role of first lady.[273]She is often seen as cold by the public, though people who interact with her describe her as a warm presence.[5][274]As with previous first ladies, Melania\\'s fashion was heavily scrutinized, and particularly expensive pieces were criticized.[190]More than other first ladies, her fashion was scrutinized in the context of her past as a fashion model and her marriage to a billionaire.[275]She did her own clothes shopping,[276][277]but she was assisted by designerHervé Pierre,[278]hair stylist Mordechai Alvow, and make up artist Nicole Byrl.[279]When preparing for speeches, she dedicated more attention to her physical appearance than content or delivery, which her staff felt affected her ability to promote her causes.[280]Despite her experience in fashion, she disliked that it was such a major aspect of news coverage about her as first lady.[281]Melania has been seen by the American public as the first foreigner first lady. The only other first lady to be born outside of the United States had an American father.[282]Having a Slovenian-born woman as the American first lady became a point of national pride in Slovenia, and it gave the nation a sense of recognition on the world stage.[283][284]Melania\\'s hometown Sevnica has developed a small tourist industry around her, and Melania-themed merchandise was common during her tenure as first lady. These items never used Melania\\'s full name, substituting it with \"first lady\" or \"M\", as she is protective of herpersonality rights.[285]During the 2016 presidential election, Melania became the only candidate\\'s spouse since polling began in 1988 to have a disapproval rating greater than their approval rating.[286]Her approval rating stood at 36 or 37% in the months leading up to becoming first lady in January 2017,[287][154]but it increased to 57% in a CNN poll in April 2018 after she received public sympathy amid allegations that her husband had committed adultery.[240][288]Melania finished her tenure in 2021 as the least popular first lady since polling began with a rating of 42%.[289]Multiple polls during her tenure as first lady showed her as the most popular member of the Trump family.[287][290][291]In December 2020, theSiena College Research Institutereleased a study surveying scholars and historians on their assessments of American first ladies. It was the fifth such first ladies study that the Institute had conducted since 1982, and the first in which Melania appeared. She was ranked as being the worst of 40 assessed American first ladies,[292]receiving the lowest assessments in all of the metrics that were weighed.[293]Footnotes^Pronounced/məˈlɑːniə/mə-LAH-nee-ə^Name prior to her marriage:Melania Knauss(German:[meˈlaːni̯aˈknaʊs]), aGermanizationof her Slovene birth nameMelanija Knavs(Slovene:[mɛˈlaːnijaˈknaːws]).Notes^\"Melania Trump votes in N.Y. primary\".The Washington Post.

Biden Jr.The biography for President Trump and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association.Donald John Trump was born in Queens, New York, on June 14, 1946. His father, Fred Trump was a successful real estate developer. Trump was educated at the New York Military Academy and the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania.In 1971, he took over his father’s real estate company, renaming it the Trump Organization. The business soon became involved in variety of projects, including hotels, resorts, residential and commercial building, casinos, and golf courses. His first of many books wasThe Art of the Deal, published in 1987. In 2004, he launched the reality television showThe Apprentice.In 2005, Donald Trump married Melania Knauss. They have one son, Barron. Trump also has four adult children from previous marriages: Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany.During the 2016 primary, Trump defeated more than a dozen rivals to win the Republican nomination. While he lost the popular vote, Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the general election by winning a majority of Electoral College votes. His campaign slogan was “Make America Great Again.”Without previous elected political experience, President Trump used unconventional methods to communicate his priorities. Most notably, he used the social media platform Twitter as a primary mechanism for direct communication with the American public, other politicians, and the press corps.As president, he signed a major tax reform bill into law and oversaw a reduction of federal regulations. His protectionist trade policies included tariffs in foreign aluminum, steel, and other products. The Trump administration also renegotiated trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea. Other domestic priorities included Supreme Court and federal judiciary appointments, increased military budgets, aggressive border and immigration control, criminal justice reform, and the reduction of prescription drug prices.In foreign policy, the Trump administration moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and brokered normalization agreements between Israel and a number of countries. In 2018, President Trump attended a summit with Kim Jong Un, marking the first time a sitting president met with a North Korean leader.In 2018, there was a partial government shutdown as Trump disagreed with Congress over funding for a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The funding lapse lasted thirty-five days before it was resolved.In 2019, a federal whistleblower filed a complaint that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter, who had served on the board of Bursima Holdings, a natural gas company in Ukraine. Later that year, the House of Representatives impeached President Trump based upon allegations of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. In 2020, the Senate acquitted Trump on both articles of impeachment.The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the United States on January 20, 2020. The remainder of Trump’s presidency was consumed with the coronavirus pandemic. Critics argued that Trump’s response to the pandemic was delayed and did not sufficiently encourage public health practices to reduce the spread of the virus. However, the Trump administration’s program “Operation Warp Speed” assisted in the private sector development of two approved vaccines. Nonetheless, by the time Trump left office, more than 400,000 Americans had died of COVID-19.Trump lost reelection to Democratic candidate Joe Biden, but publicly claimed widespread voter fraud had affected the outcome. Supporters of President Trump traveled to Washington, D.C. for a “Save America” rally on January 6, 2021. Trump spoke to the large crowd on the Ellipse near the White House and encouraged attendees to protest the counting of the Electoral College votes in Congress. The rally turned violent when the president’s supporters overwhelmed law enforcement, breaching the United States Capitol and disrupting the vote count. Five people died as a result of the violence, and the Capitol complex suffered millions of dollars in damage.On January 13, 2021, Trump’s actions resulted in the House of Representatives approving another article of impeachment: the incitement of insurrection. He is the only president in American history to be impeached twice by Congress.Learn more about Donald Trump’s spouse,Melania Trump.Stay ConnectedSign UpEmail Address*RequiredZIP CodePlease leave blank.We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.ShareShare this page on FacebookShare this page on Xhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/donald-j-trump/?utm_source=linkHomeThe AdministrationExecutive OfficesPrioritiesThe RecordBriefing RoomThe White HouseVisitDisclosuresGet InvolvedEspañolContact UsPrivacy PolicyCopyright PolicyAccessibility StatementInstagramOpens in a new windowFacebookOpens in a new windowXOpens in a new windowYouTubeOpens in a new windowLinkedInOpens in a new windowThreadsOpens in a new windowRedditOpens in a new windowSnapchatOpens in a new windowThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500WH.govScroll to TopScroll to TopTop\"),\n",

He wasinauguratedaspresident of the United Stateson January 20, 2017, and filed for re-election with theFederal Election Commission(FEC) on the same day.Trump began his re-election campaign unusually early for anincumbentpresident, beginning to spend money on the re-election effort within weeks of his election. From February 2017 onward, Trumpheld more than 150 ralliesand fundraisers for this campaign, visiting key electoral states. The campaign also raised funds and ran two nationwide advertising campaigns. Trump said in severalstump speechesthat the slogans for the 2020 race would be \"Keep America Great\" and \"Promises Made, Promises Kept\".[23][24][25]On November 7, 2018, Trump confirmed thatMike Pencewould be his vice presidential running mate in 2020.[26]Trump\\'s re-election bid was ultimately unsuccessful; theDemocratic Partyticket ofJoe BidenandKamala Harriswon the 2020 election. This marked the first time since1992that an incumbent president lost reelection. Trump refused to accept the results; he and his allies made false and disproven claims of fraud, pressured elections officials, filed several unsuccessful lawsuits,[27][28][29]and directlyattempted to overturn the resultsat the county, state, and federal level. This culminated in theattack on the United States Capitolon January 6, 2021, for whichTrump was impeached a second time. The day after the attack, Trump stated that a \"new administration\" would be succeeding his, without mentioning president-elect Biden by name, in a video posted onTwitter.[30][31][32]Background[edit]Trump\\'s predecessors merged their campaign committees into their party\\'s committee following their election victories. Following his 2016 election victory, Trump eschewed this presidential tradition and retained a separate campaign committee which continued raising funds. In December 2016, the campaign raised $11million.[33]These moves indicated that Trump was already eyeing a 2020 run.[34]Trump started spending money on the 2020 race on November 24, 2016 (sixteen days after the end of the2016 election). The earliest campaign disbursement that his committees reported was spent towards the 2020 presidential primaries was for the purchase of aDelta Air Linesticket on this date.[35]Trump officially filed his re-election campaign with theFECon January 20, 2017, the day ofhis inauguration.[36][37][38][39]Trump launched his re-election campaign earlier in his presidency than his predecessors did.Barack Obama(2012),George W. Bush(2004),Bill Clinton(1996),George H. W. Bush(1992) andRonald Reagan(1984) all declared their candidacies for reelection in the third year of their presidencies.[40][41]His immediate successor,Joe Biden(2024), also declared his candidacy for reelection in the third year ofhis presidency. Trump filed the papers for his re-election campaign approximately 47 months prior to the date of the election.[40]In contrast, both Reagan and George H. W. Bush did so approximately twelve, George W. Bush approximately eighteen, and both Clinton and Obama (and later Biden) approximately nineteen months before those elections.[40]While previous presidents had held rallies in the early days of their presidency to garner support for legislation, such rallies differed from Trump\\'s in that they were funded by theWhite Houserather than by campaign committees.[41][42]One of the advantages of having his campaign committee fund the events is that organizers can more discriminately screen attendees, refusing entry to non-supporters.[43]Trump\\'s February 2017 rally inMelbourne, Florida, was the earliest campaign rally for an incumbent president.[44][45]By filing for his campaign as early as he did, Trump gave himself a head start on fundraising. This theoretically helped discourage primary challengers.[45]Since his three predecessors (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama) won re-election, had Trump been reelected, it would have been the first time in American history that four consecutive presidents were elected to two terms.[46][47]Permanent campaign[edit]Although Trump\\'s early campaign filing was extraordinarily unusual, aspects of a \"permanent campaign\" are not entirely unprecedented inAmerican politics. Such a phenomenon had a presence in the White House at least as early as thepresidency of Bill Clinton. Under the advice ofSidney Blumenthal, Clinton\\'s staff continued to engage in campaign methodology once in office, using polling for assistance in making decisions.[44][48]Political observers who bolster the opinion that a permanent campaign has had a significant impact on recent presidencies argue that decisions by presidents have increasingly been made with considerations to their impact on voter approval.[49]The concept of a permanent campaign also describes the focus which recent presidents have given to electoral concerns during their tenures in office, with the distinction between the time they have spent governing and the time they have spent campaigning having become blurred.[49]Political observers consider the rise in presidential fundraising as a symptom of the permanent campaign.[49]The disproportionately large amounts of time presidents have spent visiting key electoral states (and a comparatively small amount of time they have spent visiting states that pose little electoral importance to them) has been pointed to as evidence of ulterior electoral motives influencing presidential governance, emblematic of the blurred lines between campaigning and governance in the White House.[49][48]For instance, George W. Bush embarked on 416 domestic trips during his first three years in office. This was 114 more than his predecessor Bill Clinton made in his first three years.[48]In his first year, 36% of Bush\\'s domestic trips were to the 16 states that were consideredswing statesafter having been decided the closest margins during the2000 election.[48]In his second year, 45% of his domestic travel was to these states, and his third year 39% of his domestic travel was to these states.[48]According to theAssociated Press, a data analysis firm namedData Propria, launched in May 2018 to provide ad-targeting services and run by former officials ofCambridge Analytica, is working onpublic relationsfor the Trump 2020 re-election campaign.[50][51][52]Political positions[edit]Main article:Political positions of Donald TrumpEmerging from the2020 convention, the campaign agenda for a second term was primarily to build on the first term agenda.[53]As someGeorge Floyd protestsincluded violent incidents, Trump emphasized \"law and order\" as a major campaign theme, directing particular criticism atantifa. Trump and attorney generalBill Barrasserted that antifa had organized the protests, although there was no evidence to support that. Barr had also baselessly linked antifa to theBlack Lives Mattermovement.[54][55][56]Three August 2020DHSdraft reports did not mention antifa as adomestic terrorismrisk and rankedwhite supremacyas the top risk, higher than that of foreign terrorist groups.[57]Brian Murphy— until August 2020, the DHSundersecretary for intelligence and analysis— asserted in a September 2020 whistleblower complaint[58]that secretary of Homeland SecurityChad Wolfand his deputyKen Cuccinelliinstructed him \"to modify intelligence assessments to ensure they matched up with the public comments by President Trump on the subject of ANTIFA and \\'anarchist\\' groups\" and to downplay the severity of risk associated with white supremacy. Murphy said he refused.[59]The campaign sent a fundraising text message to supporters in September 2020 stating an \"ANTIFA ALERT,\" continuing, \"They\\'ll attack your homes if Joe\\'s elected.\"[60]Top officials tried to keep dossiers on identified protesters, whom they intended to blame for a terrorist plot that did not exist. The purpose was to help Trump win re-election.[61][62]Approval ratings[edit]See also:§\\xa0PollingPresidential approval ratings, while rising slightly throughout the second half of his first term, have generally shown Trump to be one of the least popular presidents in the history of modern opinion polling during a presidential election year.[63][64][65]Political observers point out that presidential job approval is highly partisan,[66]withGallupwriting in March 2020:The 92% approval among Republicans and 42% among independents are close to his highest ratings for those groups. Meanwhile, his approval rating among Democrats, currently 8%, hasn\\'t been above 13% since he took office in February 2017. The current 84-point gap in approval between Republicans and Democrats is just a few points shy of the record polarization Gallup found in late January and early February.[67]In the midst of theCOVID-19 pandemicin early spring 2020, Trump\\'s approval rating saw a small but notablerally in support,[68][69]followed by a tick-down in mid-2020.[70][71][72]In June and July 2020, public polling showed Trump\\'s approval significantly weakening.[73][74][75]Domestic trips made by Donald Trump as U.S. president[edit]For a more comprehensive list, seeList of presidential trips made by Donald Trump.The following maps document the frequency with which Trump has visited each state and territory during his presidency.201720182019Washington, D.C.7 or more visits6 visits5 visits4 visits3 visits2 visits1 visit0 visits2017 campaign developments[edit]See also:List of Donald Trump rallies (December 2016–2022) §\\xa0Post-inauguration ralliesJanuary 2017: launch[edit]On January 10, 2017,Politicoreported that Trump would be keeping his campaign offices inTrump Toweropen in order to lay the groundwork for a re-election campaign.[34]By that time his campaign offices at Trump Tower already included a staff of about ten people led by Republican strategistMichael Glassner.[34][4]Glassner\\'s deputy is John Pence, nephew of Vice PresidentMike Pence.[4]The campaign staff was focused on data-building and fundraising for a 2020 re-election campaign.[34][76]On January 18, Trump revealed, in an interview withThe Washington Post, that he had decidedKeep America Greatwould be his 2020 re-election campaign slogan.[20][77]Two days later, on the day of his inauguration, Trump filed a form with theFederal Election Commission(FEC) declaring that he qualified as a candidate for the2020 presidential election.[36][38][39]February 2017: first rally[edit]Trump speaking at his first campaign rally in FloridaBy February 1, 2017, Trump\\'s re-election campaign had already raised over $7\\xa0million.[78]The first rally organized by the campaign was held on February 18, 2017, inMelbourne, Florida,[79]and was attended by an estimated 9,000 supporters.[80]It was the earliest an incumbent president had ever held a re-election campaign rally.[44]During the rally, Trump defended his actions and criticized the media.[44]He referred to a nonexistent incident (\"last night in Sweden...\") while criticizing theasylumpolicies of several European countries.[81]After backlash from the press and the Swedish government,[82][83]Trump said he was referring to aFox Newsprogram aired the previous day.[84][85]On February 24, Trump spoke at theConservative Political Action Conference,[86]an annual event which has often held a presidentialstraw poll.[87]However, the CPAC 2017 straw poll did not include a preference survey on presidential candidates.[88]Trump laying a wreath at the tomb of Andrew Jackson atThe Hermitageprior to his Nashville, Tennessee rallyTrump speaking at his rally in Nashville, Tennessee, March 15, 2017Rally in Louisville, Kentucky, March 20, 2017March 2017: second and third rallies[edit]On March 4, there werea series of local ralliesheld by allies of the campaign in some fifty cities.[89]Several of the rallies were met by counter-demonstrations[90]where some protesters were arrested.[91][92]Other events were held around the country throughout March, some of which resulted in violence.[93]The campaign\\'s second rally was held a month later inNashvilleon March 15, and coincided with the 250th birthday ofAndrew Jackson.

R. McMaster, an active-duty military member who was barred from participating in any political advocacy while in uniform.[112]Subsequent airings of the advertisement substituted this clip.[107][112]The ad claimed that the \"fake news\" media refused to report the successes of the administration,[107][109][113]butForbespointed out that the ad itself cited mainstream media sources includingCNBC,The Boston GlobeandThe New York Times.[113]Because of this accusation against the news media,CNNdecided to stop running the ad, a decision that campaign manager Michael Glassner criticized as an action to \"censor our free speech\".[114]ABC,CBSandNBClater joined CNN in refusing to play the ad.[115]Lara Trump, a consultant to the campaign and the daughter-in-law of the president, called the ad removals \"an unprecedented act of censorship in America that should concern every freedom-loving citizen\".[115][116]On May 8, shortly after reporterCecilia Vegaasked White House press secretarySean Spicerabout statements that Trump\\'s 2016 campaign had issued in regard to temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States, Trump\\'s campaign website purged itself of all campaign statements from the 2016 campaign.[117][118]Campaign chairman Michael Glassner later announced that the website was being redesigned. The redesign of Trump\\'s campaign website was seen by media sources as laying the groundwork for a full-bodied reelection campaign.[119]The Washington Examiner\\'sDavid Druckert pointed out on Twitter that the redesigned website featured an image of Trump with a uniformed military officer on its \\'Donate\\' page, which violated the Department of Defense\\'s regulation that prohibits uniformed military officers from engaging in any political activity.[120]On May 18, Trump hosted chairmen of theColorado,Iowa,Michigan,New Hampshire,North Carolina,OhioandPennsylvaniastate parties at the White House. Each of their states are considered to be presidentialswing states.[121]On May 25, Trump\\'s sonsDonald Jr.andEric, along with Eric\\'s wife Lara, held a series of meetings at theWashington, D.C., offices of theRepublican National Committee(RNC) to outline campaign strategy.[122][123]June 2017: fifth rally, first fundraiser and visits to swing states[edit]Counter-protesters at the Pittsburgh Not Paris RallyOn June 1, President Trump announced his plans towithdraw from the Paris Agreementsaying, \"I was elected to represent the citizens ofPittsburgh, not Paris.\" Soon afterwards, the campaign announced it would hold aPittsburgh Not Paris Rallyacross from the White House.[124][125]The rally was held June3 atLafayette Square.

Trump highlighted Baltimore having a higher homicide rate (55.8 of 100,000 people) than the countryAfghanistan, although he did not propose a policy to address the issue.[235][236]On August 7, following the2019 Dayton shootingand the2019 El Paso shooting, Trump visitedDayton, Ohio, andEl Paso, Texas. That day, Trump fired back at Democratic presidential candidates Beto O\\'Rourke (\"be quiet\") and Joe Biden (\"boring\") who had previously criticized him.[237][238]Trump additionally labeled Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro as a \"fool\" and \"not much\" of a man.[239]While talking to medical staff at El Paso, Trump mentioned that his February 2019 campaign rally in the city had drawn a much bigger crowd than O\\'Rourke\\'s campaign rally that same day. A campaign-style video of Trump shaking hands and posing for photos during the visit was released by the White House.[240]September 2019[edit]On September 11, Trump tweeted that he has not \"even started campaigning yet\".[241]As theTrump–Ukraine scandalemerged and Trump faced an impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign launched a $10million television and web campaign with a video claiming Joe Biden had offered Ukraine $1billion if they fired a prosecutor who was \"investigating his son\\'s company\", including video of Biden boasting that the prosecutor had been fired.[242]Hunter Bidenserved on the board of directors ofBurisma Holdings, the owner of which was investigated, but Biden himself was not investigated. Then-vice president Biden had in March 2016 threatened to withhold $1billion in loan guarantees if Ukraine did not fire the prosecutor,Viktor Shokin. The Obama administration and other governments andnon-governmental organizationswere concerned that Shokin was not adequately pursuing corruption in Ukraine, was protecting the political elite, and was regarded as \"an obstacle to anti-corruption efforts\". In particular, he was seen to be slow walking the Burisma investigation.[243][244]The ad asserted that Trump had acted to fight corruption and Democrats were impeaching him for it. No evidence has surfaced of any malfeasance by the Bidens.[245]Previously, in sworn testimony, the administration officials saidGiulianidirectly conveyed the president\\'s demands to them that Ukraine launch investigations into the son of former Vice President Joe Biden and a long-debunked 2016 election-related conspiracy. However, Trump later denied sending Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to push Biden.[246]October–December 2019[edit]As the impeachment investigation continued, the campaign spent copious amounts of money defending the president against it.[247][248]Prior to December 12, three lawsuits claimed Trump\\'s business dealings have been violatingthe Constitution. All these cases advanced to critical stages in federal courts.[249]On the night of December 18, coinciding with the vote toimpeach him, Trump held a rally inBattle Creek, Michigan. He received criticism for suggesting the deceased representativeJohn Dingellmay have gone tohell.[250]The Associated Press acquired a recording of senior Trump campaign advisorJustin Clarktelling Wisconsin Republicans that \"traditionally it\\'s always been Republicans suppressing votes in places\" and 2020 would be the time to \"start playing offense a little bit\" to protect their voters. Clark asserted to the AP that he was speaking about how \"Republicans historically have been falsely accused of voter suppression.\"[251]In October, the Trump campaign ran a Facebook ad that falsely claimed Joe Biden offered to bribe Ukrainian officials to not investigate his son, Hunter Biden.[252]2020 campaign developments[edit]2020 U.S. presidential electionTimeline2017–2019January–October 2020November 2020 – January 2021Presidential debatesPartiesPollingnationalstatewideNews media endorsementsprimarygeneralFundraisingRussian interferencePresidential electorsElectoral College vote countPresidential transitionSubsequent voting restrictionsAttempts to overturnProtestsinauguration weekLawsuitspre-electionpost-electionTexas v.

At one point, Trump said he may sue Parscale, although it is unclear whether he was joking. Both Trump and Parscale denied that Trump had shouted. Parscale did not deny a conflict, and he did not deny Trump saying he may sue. Trump told the media he does not \"believe the polls\".[264][265]May 2020[edit]May 4: CNN sent acease-and-desistletter to the Trump campaign regarding its ad, \"American Comeback\", which had begun running the previous evening on cable television.[266]The ad selected words from a CNN interview and inserted them into a different context, making it a clear example of \"deceptive editing\",The Washington Postexplained.[267]June 2020[edit]June 8: After a CNN poll found Trump 14 percentage points behind Joe Biden, Trump on Twitter declared the poll \"FAKE\", saying he had \"retained highly respected pollster, McLaughlin & Associates\", to analyze that poll. The Republican Party\\'s congressional campaign arm has advised Republicans to avoid employing McLaughlin & Associates after it predicted in 2014 that Republican RepresentativeEric Cantorwould win re-election in a Republican primary by 34 points, butCantor actually lost by around 10 points. Later in 2018, McLaughlin & Associates predicted that Republican RepresentativeRob Woodallwould win re-election by 27 points, but Woodall ended upwinning by only 0.2 points.[268]June 9: The Trump campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter to CNN over their poll, demanding a retraction and apology. CNN refused.[269]During June, Trump also suggested he might sue campaign manager Brad Parscale for presenting polling data showing the president trailing in several key states.The New York Timesdescribes this incident as a jest, rather than a serious threat, and participants in the call say Parscale responded to the threat by saying, \"I love you, too.\"[270]June 10: Amid theCOVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the Trump campaign said the president would resume his campaign rallies,the firstbeing atTulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19.[271]Ticketholders must \"assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19\", and cannot hold the Trump campaign liable for resultant illness or injury.[272]The rally was later pushed back by one day to June 20, out of respect for the original date falling onJuneteenth(which was deemed insensitive due to theTulsa race massacreand the ongoingGeorge Floyd protests).[273]June 12: The RNC decided not to write a new platform for 2020, reusing 2016\\'s, which denounces the \"current president\".[274]June 15: In a tweet, then-campaign managerBrad Parscaleindicated that ticket requests for the June 20 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, had surpassed a million.[275][276]June 20: Trump heldhis first campaign rally in monthsat theBOK Centerin Tulsa. The seating capacity of thearenais 19,199,[277]and in the days leading up to the event, Parscale said more than 800,000 people had registered for the rally.[278]Attendance at the rally was estimated to be just under 6,200, according to theTulsa Fire Department.[279]The numbers projected by the campaign were inaccurate partially due toTikTokusers andK-popfans registering for the rally and not attending.[280][281]Trump spent 14 minutes (around 1/8th of the length of his speech) talking about walking hesitatingly down a ramp at theUnited States Military Academy, and the media coverage regarding the slowness of his descent.[282][283]June 23: President Trump holds rallies inPhoenixandYuma, Arizona.[284][285]July 2020[edit]CelebratingIndependence Daywith an address atMount Rushmore, Trump said he was in a battle against a \"newfar-leftfascism\".The New York Timescharacterized Trump as using the address \"to mount a full-on culture war against astraw-manversion of the left that he portrayed as inciting mayhem and moving the country toward totalitarianism\".The Washington Postreported that while \"amplifying racism and stoking culture wars have been mainstays of Trump\\'s public identity for decades, they have been particularly pronounced this summer as the president has reacted to the national reckoning over systemic discrimination by seeking to weaponize the anger and resentment of some white Americans for his own political gain.\"[286][287]On the evening of July 4, musician and entrepreneurKanye Westannouncedhis campaign for the presidency.Los Angeles Timesreported that \"It\\'s unclear whether West has filed any of the necessary paperwork to formally join the race between incumbent Donald Trump\\xa0– for whom West has expressed admiration,\" and said this \"might be part of an effort to draw Black supporters away from Biden to help Trump.\"[288]Vice President Pence and White House Press SecretaryKayleigh McEnanyclaimed that Joe Biden had asserted police had \"become the enemy\". Biden\\'s words were taken out of context, as he had actually said the use of military-grade heavy equipment by police officers can look like \"the military invading\" communities and thus makes police \"become the enemy\" in the perception of some in the community.[289]According toMedia Matters, Trump surrogateSean Hannityalso misrepresented Biden\\'s words to his radio and television audiences at least 17 times in July.[290]On July 10, the Trump campaign postponed a rally planned for the next day inPortsmouth, New Hampshire, with Tim Murtaugh, the campaign\\'s communications director citing \"safety reasons because ofTropical Storm Fay\".[291]On July 15, Trump announced that he had promoted former deputy campaign managerBill Stepiento campaign manager, replacing Brad Parscale.[292][293]On July 19, in an interview aired on Fox News, Trump called the network\\'s poll showing Biden leading by 8% \"fake\", further saying he would \"have to see\" if he would accept a loss in the election, citingpostal votingas a way it would be rigged against him.[294]According to CNN, \"There is no credible evidence that mail-in voting is rife with corruption,\"[295]and \"the concerted push by Trump to delegitimize mail-in ballots is raising alarm bells among Republican operatives, who are worried the President\\'s demand for in-person voting will mainly serve to dampen turnout among his own supporters.\"[296][c]During the first half of July, the campaign ran a television ad more than a thousand times targeted at women in Ohio, falsely asserting that Joe Biden proposes to \"defund the police\", which would increase home invasions and rapes, concluding that \"You won\\'t be safe in Joe Biden\\'s America.\" Trump won Ohio by eight points in 2016 but polls showed he was in a statistical tie with Biden in July.[299]Across numerous other states, Trump ran another ad falsely accusing Biden of proposing to defund the police, with a simulated9-1-1call response:You have reached the 9-1-1 police emergency line. Due to the defunding of the police department, we\\'re sorry but no one is here to take your call. If you are calling to report a rape, please press one. To report a murder, press two. To report a home invasion, press three. For all other crimes, leave your name and number and someone will get back to you. Our estimated wait time is currently five days. Goodbye.[300]In June and July, the campaign spent over $2million on Facebook ads. One claims (with 308 variations) that \"Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups are running through our streets and causing absolute mayhem. They are DESTROYING our cities and rioting.\"[301]In July, television ads were aired intending to portray the violent turmoil of a future Biden presidency\\xa0– utilizing images of turmoil occurring during Trump\\'s presidency.[302][301]In mid-July, theRonald Reagan Presidential Foundation& Institute formally asked the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee to stop using Reagan\\'s name and likeness for fundraising. The request came after a campaign email solicitation offered commemorative coins with images of Trump and Reagan.[303]On July 23, Trump announced the cancellation of theJacksonvilleportion of the 2020 Republican National Convention, citing rising COVID-19 numbers.[304]On July 30, he publicly suggested delaying the election due to COVID-19, despite the authority to make such a change lying with Congress.[305]Some of the most prominent leaders of the Republican Party rejected that such a prospect would be considered.[306]Later the same day, Trump walked back his comments, while repeating his condemnation of postal voting.[295][c]Responding to the comments and the president\\'s handling of the pandemic,Timothy Eganwrites in aNew York Timesopinion piece that Trump \"should do humanity a favor and surrender now\", saying this could \"save many lives of supporters who have listened to the lethal quackery from the presidential podium\".[307]According to multiple high-ranking Republicans, Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnellhas signaled to Republican Senate candidates that they may distance themselves from Trump if they feel it will help them salvage their own campaigns.[308]At the end of July, the Trump campaign temporarily halted television advertising to reassess its messaging strategy. A campaign official attributed the pause to the recent change in campaign leadership, stating, \"We\\'ll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing.\" The campaign had $146.6million budgeted for television and radio ads from Labor Day until November.[309]Television advertising was expected to resume on August 3, with a focus on states that will vote the earliest;[310]a new campaign ad features altered images to falsely portray Biden as \"alone\" and \"hiding\" in his basement.[311][312]August 2020[edit]On August 5, Trump announced that he was considering hosting his GOP convention acceptance speech from the White House, saying \"It would be the easiest from the standpoint of security.\" Fox News reported public criticism of the announcement, including from House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, and cited theHatch Act of 1939, which prohibitsexecutive-branchfederal employees other than the president and vice president from engaging in partisan political activity.[313][d]On August 6, it was reported that theCommission on Presidential Debateshad rejected the campaign\\'s request to move or add adebateto early September, before states begin early voting. The first debate is scheduled for September 29.[315]On August 14, Trump gathered about 300 police officers who support him athis golf clubinBedminster, New Jersey, and asked the crowd whether \"Sleepy Joe\" or \"Slow Joe\" was a better nickname for his opponent. The former name, which Trump has frequently used, provoked a louder response. He stated that \"PutinandKim Jong-unandPresident Xiof China, they\\'re not sleepy. We can\\'t have slow, sleepy people dealing with them.\"[316]On August 17,Miles Taylor, former chief of staff to formerDepartment of Homeland Security(DHS) secretaryKirstjen Nielsen, published an op-ed inThe Washington Postand featured in an ad fromRepublican Voters Against Trump. In the ad, Taylor says, \"What we saw [over] 2 1/2 years in that administration, was terrifying.\" He says that when the DHS raised national security concerns, Trump \"wasn\\'t interested in those things,\" and attempted to exploit the department \"for his own political purposes and to fuel his own agenda,\" including by withholding federal wildfire aid to California because he lacked support in the state. Taylor asserts that \"Years of DHS planning for a pandemic threat have been largely wasted,\" and concludes: \"Given what I experienced ... I have to support Joe Biden for president.\"[317]On August 20, Trump said in Old Forge, Pennsylvania, that \"Joe Biden is a puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. They don\\'t want energy, they don\\'t want guns, they don\\'t want religion.\" Later that day, Trump tweeted against Biden, the Obamas and mail-in voting.[318]The campaign also released a digital ad suggesting that Hunter Biden used his father\\'s vice presidency to personally profit from a Chinese bank (which Hunter denied in 2019). That night, Biden accepted his party\\'s presidential nomination at the2020 Democratic National Convention.[319]On August 22,The New York Timesreported that Trump would speak on all four nights (only one night being customary) of the 2020 Republican National Convention scheduled for the next week, that nearly half of the keynote speakers would be Trump family members, and that two former producers ofThe Apprenticewould be coordinating the event.[320]On August 23, Trump senior adviserJason Millerstated that the campaign was \"conserving money right now and focusing a little bit more smartly and a little more effectively on the states that are voting early,\" whilePoliticoreports that \"even in most of those early-voting states, Biden has dominated Trump\" regarding television ad spending.[321]On the first night of the convention (which had less viewers than both the2016 conventionand the 2020 Democratic event),[322]Donald TrumpJr. said his father\\'s policies had been \"like rocket fuel to the economy ... especially to the middle class,\" whileBiden has promised to take that money back out of your pocket and keep it inthe swamp. That makes sense though, considering Joe Biden is basically theLoch Ness Monsterof the swamp. For the past half-century, he\\'s been lurking around in there. He sticks his head up every now and then to run for president, and then he disappears and doesn\\'t do much in between.[323]On the second night of the Republican National Convention, Secretary of StateMike Pompeospoke from Jerusalem (where he was on state business), prompting an investigation by House Democrats to determine whether this violated the Hatch Act, which Pompeo had instructed federal employees to obey earlier in the year. The use of the convention to perform a naturalization ceremony[e]and reveal thepresidential pardonofJon Ponderalso drew scrutiny for using government business to promote Trump\\'s campaign.[325][326][327]On the final night of the convention, Trump stated:Your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens. And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it.[328]On August 31, Trump asserted in an interview withLaura Ingrahamthat Biden is being controlled by \"People that you\\'ve never heard of, people that are in the dark shadows.\" When the program host said this sounded like thepromotion of a conspiracy theory, Trump elaborated that \"They\\'re people that are on the streets, they\\'re people that are controlling the streets.\" He further claimed that someone \"from a certain city\" boarded a plane which was \"almost completely loaded with thugs [around seven in total] wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms with gear and this and that,\" to come to the Republican National Convention \"to do big damage.\"[f]Then, prompted by Ingraham to discuss how Biden\\'s campaign was being financed, he said, \"The money is coming from some very stupid rich people who have no idea that if their thing ever succeeded, which it won\\'t, they will be thrown to the wolves like you\\'ve never seen before.\"[329]In late August, the Trump campaign shared a video featuring the soundbite of Joe Biden saying: \"You won\\'t be safe in Joe Biden\\'s America.\" The quote was taken wholly out of context, as Biden was instead attributing this quote to \"Trump and Pence\", while Biden was stating that images of violence were actually that of \"Donald Trump\\'s America today\". Meanwhile, White House social media directorDan Scavinoshared a fake video purportedly showing Biden sleeping during a live interview. In fact, the fake video combined two different clips: one of Biden looking down with eyes half-closed, and one of an interviewer asking activist Harry Belafonte to \"wake up\". The fake video also had new audio added, of snoring sounds.[330]September 2020[edit]On September 2, Trump told WECT-TV in Wilmington, North Carolina, that people should vote twice—once in person and again by mail—to see if anyone stops them from committing this illegal act. When CNN asked U.S. Attorney GeneralBill Barrfor his input, Barr claimed he did not know whether it was illegal to vote twice.[331]Barr also told CNN that he believed that China was the biggest active threat to U.S. election security (contradicting U.S. intelligence, whichhad identified Russia) and that foreign adversaries would likely sow the system with fraudulent mail-in ballots (although he admitted he had no evidence of this).[332]On September 3, Trump spoke in Pennsylvania. He encouraged voters to vote in person, referencing potential mail fraud or ballots going missing. He also focused on topics of the economy and public safety in light of mass protests and riots.[333]He attacked Biden for mixed messages on fracking and for wearing a mask so much during the COVID-19 pandemic.[334][333]The New York Timesreported on September 5 that the Trump campaign had spent $58 million of donor money on legal bills, far exceeding the levels of his predecessors at similar points in their campaigns. The spending included routine matters, and legal work involving the Russia investigation and his impeachment, as well as relating to enforcement of nondisclosure agreements with former associates and his personal business interests.[335]On September 7,The New York Timesreported the campaign might be facing a cash crunch, having spent more than $800 million of the $1.1 billion raised from early 2019 through July. TheTimesreported the campaign had engaged in profligate spending until the new campaign manager Bill Stepien imposed controls. The next day, Trump stated he was prepared to spend his own money if necessary.[336][337]From September 8–12, the Trump campaign released a \"Support Our Troops\" advertisement with a picture of silhouetted RussianMikoyan MiG-29fighter jets and soldiers carrying at least one RussianAK-74assault rifle, that drew international commentary.[338][339]On September 10,The Washington Postreported that campaign manager Bill Stepien had already reduced spending on television ads. \"Between Aug. 10 and Sept. 7, Biden\\'s campaign spent about $90 million on television ads, more than four times the $18 million spent by the Trump campaign,\" the reporters said.[340][341][342]On September 13, Trump held a rally inHenderson, Nevada. Due to the pandemic, it was his first indoor rally sincethe Tulsa rallyin June, and it violated Nevada\\'s prohibition against gatherings of more than 50 people.[343][344][345]The Associated Press reported on September 14 that, although the Trump campaign had spent heavily for months, it did not seem to have hurt Biden in the polls, and the Trump campaign no longer could count on having more cash than the Biden campaign. Biden, while achieving record-breaking fundraising in August, outspent Trump by nearly double that same month. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign canceled advertising in several states, while retaining $200 million worth of reserved ads, characterizing the cancellations as strategic.[346]Trump held a rally on September 18 inBemidji, Minnesota. Afterward 16COVID-19cases were traced to the rally and four more to a protest held just outside.[347]On September 23, Trump was asked if he would commit to apeaceful transition of powerif he lost the 2020 election, to which he replied: \"Well, we\\'ll have to see what happens.\" He also said at a press briefing, \"I\\'ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. Get rid of the ballots and you\\'ll have a very peaceful — there won\\'t be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.\"[348]That same day, he said it was important to confirm his incoming Supreme Court nominee promptly because he believed the election outcome would be determined by the Supreme Court and he needed a majority to overcome \"this scam that the Democrats are pulling.\"[349]Also that day, Donald Trump Jr. asserted in social media posts that \"The radical left are laying the groundwork to steal this election from my father,\" adding, \"Their plan is to add millions of fraudulent ballots that can cancel your vote and overturn the election,\" asking \"able-bodied\" people to join an election security \"army\" for his father.[350]On September 23, Eric Trump shared a video on Twitter, showing Joe Biden looking away from the camera during an interview with Telemundo. Eric Trump used this to falsely claim that Biden was using a teleprompter. This was re-shared by Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller, and then Trump himself. In actuality, Biden was looking away from the camera because there was a monitor off-screen where Telemundo viewers were shown asking Biden questions. Biden was replying to one such viewer directly.[351]Meanwhile, the Trump campaign ran video and pictorial advertisements on Facebook, YouTube, and Google, which falsely claimed that Joe Biden used a teleprompter during an April 2020 interview with James Corden. A teleprompter was seen on Biden\\'s screen during that interview, but that was in fact Corden\\'s teleprompter, not Biden\\'s. The teleprompter was shared on the screens of Corden\\'s interviewees via Zoom. The Trump campaign used the advertisement to claim that Biden \"can\\'t handle an interview\", \"can\\'t handle presidency\".[352]Another deceptive advertisement ran by the Trump campaign claimed that \"Joe Biden completely botches thePledge of Allegiance\", as Biden had paraphrased the Pledge. However, Biden\\'s words were taken out of context, as Biden was not trying to legitimately recite the Pledge; rather, he was referencing specific parts of it while he argued that he would govern as president for all states, instead of only Democratic-controlled states.[353]Trump\\'s support among seniors weakened significantly going into the final weeks of the campaign.[354]On September 24 he announced he was sending $200 drug discount cards to 33 million Medicare recipients, at a cost approaching $7 billion.[355]On September 25, Trump unveiled his \"Platinum Plan for Black America\", promising $500 billion in capital access, as well as \"creating 3 million new jobs, and bridging historic disparities in health care and education\" and makingJuneteentha national holiday.[356]On September 29, the candidates participated in a first debate in Cleveland. The event was characterized by Trump frequently interrupting both Biden and moderatorChris Wallace. This prompted the debate commission to announce that microphones would be cut off at the next debate if the rules are broken by either candidate.[357]On September 30, three cases of COVID-19 were traced to a Trump rally held inDuluth, Minnesota.[347]Musician Eddy Grant\\'s copyright infringement lawsuit[edit]In September 2020, musicianEddy Grantsued Trump for unauthorized use of Grant\\'s 1983 chart hitElectric Avenue (song)in an August 2020 presidential campaign video. Trump posted the video onTwitterwhere it was viewed more than 13 million times before Twitter took it down after Grant\\'s copyright complaint. Grant\\'s song plays during 40 seconds of the animated 55-second video.[358][359][360]Trump unsuccessfully attempted to have the suit dismissed, citing fair use and \"absolute presidential immunity\".[361][362][363]Grant asked for $300,000 in damages.[362]Trump\\'s attorney told the court that the deposition contained sensitive information about Trump\\'s presidential campaign strategy. He asked that Trump and campaign advisorDan Scavino\\'s testimony be permanently sealed because it would give an \"unwarranted competitive advantage\" to his opponents in the 2024 presidential election, and because it \"could be used against them in other, parallel, litigations unrelated to this matter.\".[364]The case, Grant v. Trump (1:20-cv-07103), is pending in federal court in the Southern District New York.[365]October 2020[edit]On October 2, two hours after it was announced that White House senior advisorHope Hickshad tested positive for COVID-19,[366][367]Trump tweeted that both he and First LadyMelania Trumphad tested positive as well and would immediately go into quarantine.[368]As a result, they cancelled all in-person campaign events scheduled in the coming days, including a rally in Orlando-Sanford International Airport.[369]Several otherWhite House members and associates tested positivefor the virus, including Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien.[370]The Trump campaign ran Facebook advertisements featuring fake photos altered to show Joe Biden wearing an earpiece. The advertisements included captions including: \"Who is in Joe\\'s ear?\", and that Biden \"declined an earpiece inspection\" at the debate. Asked to comment on the advertisements, the Trump campaign claimed that they were \"obvious satire\".[371]On October 7, Vice President Pence participated in a debate with SenatorKamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for vice president on the Biden ticket, that was held byUSA Todayand moderated bySusan Page, the Washington bureau chief of the newspaper.[372]Trailing in polls during the month leading to the election, Trump became increasingly insistent that his political adversaries be indicted, including Biden, former president Obama and Hillary Clinton, and that documents be declassified and released, including Clinton\\'s emails.[373][374]Six weeks after the Republican convention, the Trump campaign canceled all television and radio advertising in Ohio, Iowa and New Hampshire, and substantially reduced advertising in four other states.[375]On October 15, Biden and Trump hosted separate town hall speeches, in lieu of a second debate.[376]Trump at a rally inOmaha, Nebraska, on October 27Trump at October 28 rally at Phoenix airport, ArizonaOn October 22, the candidates participated in a second and final debate in Nashville. In contrast to the first debate, the microphones of both candidates were muted at select times.[377]Trump pressed Biden on renewed allegations that during his time as vice president, members of his family had personally profited from his position in Ukraine and China, to which Biden pointed out Trump\\'s own scandals regarding those countries.[378]Trump repeatedly asked why Biden had not delivered on his 2020 campaign promises during his eight years in the White House, to which Biden responded, \"we had a Republican Congress.\"[379]On October 26, theMinnesota Department of Healthlinked 23 COVID-19 cases to three Trump rallies held inthe statein September. According toJohns Hopkins University, the average number of new cases in Beltrami County, where Trump\\'s rally in Bemidji was held, was 2.85 new cases a day but had risen to 14.57 new cases per day four weeks after the rally. Minnesota traced one case each to a September 18 Joe Biden rally and an event on October 1 in Becker that was attended byEric Trump.[380]A campaign rally by Vice PresidentMike PenceinHibbingin late October had \"more than 650 people in attendance, exceeding Minnesota health guidelines to restrict crowds to 250 people.\" At least five aides to Pence, including his chief of staffMarc Short, had tested positive only two days earlier.National Security AdvisorRobert O\\'Briencalled Pence \"an essential worker\" who needed to be out campaigning.[381]Election Day and beyond[edit]Further information:Post-election lawsuits related to the 2020 United States presidential electionandRepublican reactions to Donald Trump\\'s claims of 2020 election fraudEarly on November 4, despite the fact that no clear winner of the election had been determined, Trump declared victory from the White House, stating that he \"did win the election\". At that point, results from states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia were unclear.[382]Although Trump was leading in the vote count of those states at the time, experts believed that many of the still-uncounted votes—which included votes from large cities and mail-in ballots—would turn out to favor Biden.[383]On November 5, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Trump campaign to stop vote-counting in Pennsylvania. The Trump campaign had alleged that its observers were not given access to observe the vote, but during the hearing, its lawyers admitted that its observers were already present in the vote-counting room.[384]Also that day, a state judge dismissed another lawsuit by the Trump campaign that alleged that in Georgia, late-arriving ballots were counted. The judge ruled that no evidence had been produced that the ballots were late.[385]Meanwhile, in Michigan, a state judge dismissed the Trump\\'s campaign\\'s lawsuit requesting a pause in vote-counting to allow access to observers, as the judge noted that vote-counting had already finished in Michigan.[386]That judge also noted that the official complaint did not state \"why\", \"when, where, or by whom\" an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballot-counting in Michigan.[387]On November 5, the Trump Victory in Wisconsin group declared it would be \"chasing our absentee ballots over in Pennsylvania\" for people who had yet to vote. Also, that day, the Kenosha for Trump group sent an email urging \"volunteers to make phone calls to Pennsylvania Trump supporters to return their absentee ballots\". However, votes had to be postmarked by November 3 to count as legal votes in Pennsylvania, and Trump himself has described late votes as election fraud.[388]By November 6, a growing number of Trump officials had admitted that the incumbent\\'s loss was probable.[389]On that day, election-calling organizationDecision Desk HQforecast that Trump had lost the election to Biden.[390]By November 7, news organizationsABC News,Associated Press,CBS News,CNN,Fox News,NBC News,Reuters, andtheNew York Timesforecast that Trump had lost the election to Biden.[391]Still, the president refused to concede. The administrator of the GSA,Emily W. Murphy, refused to authorize transition funds until November 23.[392][393]Most Senate Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, claimed that the election was still unsettled,[394]and Attorney General William Barr authorized the Justice Department to investigate alleged \"massive voter fraud,\" prompting Assistant AGRichard Pilger, director of the elections crimes branch in the Justice Department\\'s Public Integrity Section, to resign in protest.[395]Reliable sources indicated that there were plans to resume full-scale campaigning in conjunction with recounts in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin.[396][397]On the week of November 9, Trump indicated to Kevin Cramer that \"If this doesn\\'t work out, I\\'ll just run againin four years.\"[398]As repeated lawsuits failed throughout November, Trump admitted to Fox News on November 29 that \"it\\'s very hard to get a case to the Supreme Court.\"[399]In an interview with the Associated Press published December 1, Attorney General William Barr acknowledged: \"To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\"[400]By January, Trump had lost 60 lawsuits.[401]Further information:Trump–Raffensperger phone callOn January 2, 2021, during an hour-long conference call, Trump pressuredGeorgia Secretary of StateBrad Raffenspergerto changethe state\\'s vote totalsby the 11,780 votes he needed to win the state. During the call, Trump falsely suggested that Raffensperger could have committed a criminal offense. On January 11, the phone call was cited in anew article of impeachmentintroduced in the House of Representatives.[402]Sign with Pence removed after Pence fell out of favorSign for 2020 updated for 2024Self-declared \"alternate electors\" voted in protest; these votes had no legal validity.[403]Well over a hundred Republican representatives promised to contest the counting ceremony at the U.S. Capitol on January 6.[404][405]Experts debated whether Trump was trying to perform aself-coup.[406][407]Further information:January 6 United States Capitol attackOn January 6, 2021, Trump spoke at a \"March to Save America\" rally onthe Ellipse, where he encouraged the crowd to \"fight like hell\" and said he would be marching with them to theUnited States Capitol, although he did not join them in the end. The rioters broke into the Senate Chamber where the electoral college ballots were being counted, causing both the House and Senate to be evacuated. Five people died from the events, while dozens more were injured, and theFederal Bureau of Investigationopened over 170 investigations into the events.Polling[edit]Opinion polls conducted in 2020 almost always showed Democratic nominee Joe Biden leading Trump nationally in general election matchups, with the former vice president\\'s advantage usually extending beyond themargin of sampling error.[408][409][410]The Trump campaign dismissed polls throughout the election season, noting how they erroneously predicted aHillary Clintonvictory in the2016 presidential election.[411][412][413]The sentiment has reflected a greater public distrust of polls in general, with several studies including one by thePew Research Centershowing that even when Biden lead Trump by a significant margin nationally, a majority of people still believed that Trump would win the election.[414]After keeping pace with Biden and even leading him in some key states throughout the spring, Trump\\'s approval rating significantly weakened in June and July, causing him to fall behind in most of those battleground states as well as states that historically vote Republican such as Georgia, Texas and Kansas.[73][74][75]By July 4, 2020,Politicoreported that Trump was \"trailing [Biden] by double digits in recent polls\".[415]A mid-JulyWashington Post/ABC News poll showed Biden\\'s double-digit lead holding.[416]Trump, however, began to bounce back in early August. A national poll conducted then showed Biden leading by just three percent nationally.[417]Trump also began to improve in state polls, such as in Iowa, where a poll showed Trump leading Biden by 48% to 45%, six percentage points less than Trump won the state with in 2016, but an improvement from where Trump\\'s popularity was in the few months prior.[418]Internal polls commissioned by the campaign showed Trump tied with or ahead of Biden in 17 key states,[419]while a CNN poll showed Biden up by just one percentage point in 15 battleground states.[420]Towards the end of the month though, Biden\\'s advantage began to grow again, as Trump found himself down several points nationally in three highly rated polls: Fox News who had Biden leading 49% to 42%,[421]the NBC/Wall Street Journalwho had Biden leading 50% to 41%,[422]andThe Washington Post/ABC News who had Biden up 53% to 41%.[423]Trump got a slight bounce following the2020 Republican National Convention, after which aReuters/Ipsospoll showed Biden\\'s national lead reduced to seven points.[414]By the end of August, Trump was polling ahead of Biden in key states such as Ohio where he led 50% to 45%, and was polling neck-and-neck with the Democratic candidate in other battleground states such as Florida.[424][425]Trump\\'s national polling numbers fell heavily again following his performance at the first presidential debate and hisCOVID-19 diagnosisat the end of September and beginning of October, as Biden\\'s lead returned to double digits regularly. A Washington Post/ABC News poll taken around this period showed Biden\\'s lead to be 53% to 43%.[426]Trump, however, still managed to keep pace with Biden in the battleground states, thus giving him an outside chance of retaining the presidency via theElectoral Collegeas Election Day approached.Finances[edit]Trump began fundraising for his reelection campaign immediately after his inauguration, whereas his predecessors had waited years to do this.[162]By September 2020, Trump\\'s 2020 reelection effort, including the Republican National Committee, had spent over $800 million. At that time, Trump had not yet contributed any of his own money to his reelection effort, although he was reportedly considering contributing $100 million. (He had, by contrast, contributed $66 million of his own money to his 2016 campaign.)Bloomberg Newssaid, \"it would be unprecedented for an incumbent president to put his own money toward winning a second term.\"[427][428]Donald J.

Trump for President\", \"Trump Victory\", and \"Trump Make America Great Again Committee\") reported raising a combined $13.2million, the majority of which had come from small donors.[101]Trump\\'s campaign and the Republican National Committee ultimately raised a combined $55million in the first quarter. According to theNational Review\\'s Kelly Jane Torrance, Barack Obama and theDemocratic National Committeehad raised roughly $16million in the same period of Obama\\'s first term.[21]On March 17, 2017, the campaign saw what its highest single-day contribution total was, with the campaign and its joint-fundraising-committee raising a combined total of $314,000.[445][446]By the end of May the RNC had raised more than $62million in 2017. The RNC had already received more online donations than they had in the entire year of 2016.[149]On April 14, 2019, the campaign announced that it had raised $30million in the first quarter of 2019, far outpacing the campaigns of his individual Democratic opponents in the same period. Average donations were $34.26, and nearly 99 percent of donations to the campaign were $200 or less. In addition, the Republican National Committee brought in $45.8million in first-quarter 2019.[447]Notable expenditures and allegations of grifting[edit]Trump properties[edit]In June 2018, ProPublica reported that Trump Organization properties had received \"at least $16.1million...from his campaign, Republican organizations, and government agencies\" since late 2015.[448]In October 2019,OpenSecretsfound that total spending on Trump properties had increased to $16.8million even when just considering payments made by the Trump campaign and other Republican political campaigns and PACs (leaving aside the government agencies).[449]During the first three months of 2017, the Trump 2020 campaign reported spending $6.3million, of which nearly $500,000 (over 6% of its spending) was to companies owned by Trump.[450]In the Trump 2020 campaign\\'s first two years (2017 and 2018), it paid more than $890,000 in rent for space in Trump Tower,[451][452]while the Republican National Committee paid $225,000.[452]As of October 2020, the campaign\\'s committees had directed more than $17.9million of campaign donor money to Trump properties, while the Republican National Committee had paid $3.0million.[453][454]Legal and compliance work[edit]In a period spanning 2015–2020, the Trump campaign (including its 2016 and 2020 versions) used at least $58.4 million of donor funds to pay for legal and compliance work. (This was more than 5 times what the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee had paid for legal and compliance work during an equivalent period eight years earlier.) Federal Election Commission filings do not reveal how much the Trump campaign spent on any specific case as contrasted with routine legal work.[455]To look at a narrower slice of this spending, in the third quarter of 2017, the Trump campaign spent $4.1million (27% of its expenditures) on legal fees, including the personal legal expenses of Trump and his family.[456][457]By this point, 10% of the campaign\\'s overall spending since the beginning of the year had been on legal fees.[457]Advertisements[edit]As of March\\xa02019[update], Trump\\'s campaign had spent almost twice as much on Facebook andGoogle adsas the entire Democratic field combined. During 2020, Donald Trump\\'s campaign had spent $201 million on digital marketing, and $175 million on traditional television ads. Comparatively, the Biden campaign during this same time frame had significantly ramped up their efforts, spending $166 million on digital marketing, and $250 million on traditional television ads, respectively, outspending Trump\\'s campaign in television ads, but falling behind in digital marketing. Donald Trump and Joe Biden\\'s advertisement efforts during the 2020 election cycle are the two most expensive in history.[458][459]Memorabilia[edit]During the first three months of his presidency, his reelection campaign spent more than $4million on memorabilia.[21]Money funneled through Brad Parscale[edit]Between January 2017 and March 2020, Trump\\'s reelection committees paid $38.9million to companies owned by Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale. In the analysis of Democratic political consultant James Carville, \"They\\'re all just fleecing the campaign... Everybody is trying to take everything they can get on the way out.\"[460]Former GOP strategist andLincoln ProjectactivistRick Wilson, noting that Parscale bought a Ferrari, a Land Rover, a waterfront house and a yacht, said the campaign\\'s leaders \"are taking Donald Trump to the cleaners\".[461]In April 2020, it was revealed that Brad Parscale was paying $180,000 per year to Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., and another $180,000 per year to Lara Trump, wife of Eric Trump. \"It\\'s donor money,\" said Paul Ryan, an expert on campaign finance with the watchdog groupCommon Cause. Parscale was paying these women through his company, not through the campaign or the party. \"I can pay them however I want to pay them,\" Parscale told reporters. Two anonymous Republicans in the White House suggested that the payments were deliberately made this way, so the campaign did not have to report them.Stuart Stevens, a top aide in Mitt Romney\\'s 2012 presidential campaign, accused Parscale of being \"a money launderer\".[462]Groups supporting Trump[edit]The Republican Party[edit]On January 23, 2019, the Republican National Committee, in a unanimous vote, informally endorsed the president.[196][197]Super PACs[edit]Super PACssupporting Trump\\'s reelection campaign includeCommittee to Defend the President,[17]Great America PAC,[17]andGreat America Committee.[463][464]The Great America PAC received donations from, among others, former racerWalker Evans[465]andInsperityexecutive Jay Mincks.[466]The Committee to Defend the President PAC received contributions from, among others,Enterprise Productsexecutive Ralph S. Cunningham.[467]TheCenter for Public Integritypublished an analysis of 2017 first-quarter federal campaign spending records which revealed that two Super PACs supporting Trump,Great America PACandCommittee to Defend the President, had spent a combined $1.32million on the 2020 election campaign.[17]Ted Harveyserves as the chairman of the Committee to Defend the President.Eric BeachandEd Rollinsserve as co-chairmen of Great America PAC.[17]Both PACs have previously been accused by the FEC of poorly maintaining financial records and had been threatened with penalties.[17]The Center for Public Integrity also found that several other pro-Trump PACs had already been founded in 2017, but most of them had yet to be very active. One such PAC wasAmerica First Action, which was founded by theCEOof a political consulting firm for which Trump\\'s 2020 campaign treasurer is the senior vice president.[17]On May 17, 2017, Mike Pence filed FEC paperwork to formGreat America Committee, a PAC that would be headed by his former campaign staffersNick Ayersand Marty Obst.[463][464]This is the first time in U.S. history a sitting vice president has founded such a political organization.[463]On August 7,Marc Lotter, a spokesperson for Mike Pence, confirmed to MSNBC\\'sHallie Jacksonthat the vice president had hosted Republican donors, includingmega-donorsCharlesandDavid Koch, atNumber One Observatory Circle.[159]At the end of the third quarter, the FEC calculated that in 2017 super PACS and other outside groups supporting Trump had spent more than $2million.[468]Amount spent by outside groups in support of campaign[edit]Table displays the amount that groups have reported to the FEC they have spent in support of Trump\\'s candidacy from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020.[469]GroupAmountThe Committee to Defend the President13,977,787.95Great America PAC13,841,286.33Other31,416,965.73Total59,236,040.01Other groups[edit]In late January 2017, several members of Trump\\'s 2016 campaign staff formedAmerica First Policies, a pro-Trump political nonprofit. Those involved included former deputy campaign chairsRick GatesandDavid Bossie.Brad Parscale[470]andKatrina Piersonwere also involved. Additionally involved were Nick Ayers and Marty Obst, both of whom served as advisors to Mike Pence during the 2016 campaign.[471]Trump\\'s formerWhite House Deputy Chief of StaffKatie Walshhas also joined the organization.[122]Near the end of May, members of the organization (including Walsh) participated in meetings at the RNC\\'s D.C. offices with members Trump\\'s family to discuss campaign strategy.[122][123]In 2017, Matt Braynard, a key member of Trump\\'s 2016 campaign staff, established the organizationLook Ahead America.[472]The organization took steps to target inactive voters in places such as New Hampshire,[472]a state Trump came close to winning in 2016.[472]Look Ahead America claimed it would not coordinate its efforts with the president.[472]In the week after the 2020 election, Braynard launched a group calledThe Voter Integrity Fundto review public records for indications of election malfeasance.[473]On December 1, 2020, he tweeted that Biden\\'s election was illegitimate: \"If the issues we raised are not resolved...[Biden] cannot be considered \\'president\\' but [should] instead [be] referred to as the #presidentialoccupant.\" Trump retweeted Braynard\\'s comment several hours later.[474]In August 2018, a group called the 45 Alliance was formed. All three of the group\\'s officers had served on Trump\\'s transition team, and two of them also served in Trump\\'s White House. During the calendar year in which the 45 Alliance was formed, it was entirely funded by Trump for America, a nonprofit that supportedTrump\\'s 2016 transition($150,000); by America First Policies ($150,000); and by the Republican National Committee ($75,000). Neil Corkery is in charge of the 45 Alliance\\'s finances. \"He has ties to several high-profile dark money operations,\" Walker Davis wrote, \"like the Wellspring Committee andJudicial Crisis Network. In 2018, an anonymous million-dollar contribution to President Trump\\'s inauguration was linked to him.\"[475]Black Voices for Trumpwas an initiative of the campaign which raised support for Donald Trump among African Americans.[476][477][478]In August 2023,Harrison Floyd, the executive director of Black Voices for Trump, was charged with three felonies as part of theprosecution of Donald Trump in Georgia.[479]Rallies[edit]Main article:List of Donald Trump rallies (December 2016–2022)2020 campaign ralliesDate of rallyCityStateVenueEstimated attendanceSourceMonday, February 11, 2019El

This technology detects when a smartphone is within a narrow geographic area like a church or a sports stadium, and it captures identifying information from that device. This allowed political marketers to gather names, addresses, and voter registration status of the people who were present at the event and who presumably share some ideological, religious, or other demographic affinities. In January 2020,The New York Timesreported that \"the Trump campaign is far ahead of the Democratic Party in the use of this technology.\"[558]See also[edit]Donald Trump 2000 presidential campaignDonald Trump 2016 presidential campaignDonald Trump 2024 presidential campaignFacebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandalList of Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign endorsementsList of Republicans who opposed the Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaignOpinion polling on the first Donald Trump administrationPolitical positions of Donald TrumpPresidency of Donald TrumpWhite House COVID-19 outbreak2020 Republican Party presidential primariesList of lawsuits relating to the 2020 United States presidential electionStop the StealNotes[edit]^Informally announced on February 17, 2017^Donald Trump never conceded the election.^abOn August 3, 2020, Trump said he had the right to issue an executive order concerning mail-in voting.

Florida\\'s Voting system has been cleaned up... so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot & Vote by Mail![298]^A week later, Trump reiterated that he would \"probably be giving [his] speech at the White House\".[314]^The new citizens reportedly did not know their naturalizations would be televised. Acting Homeland Security SecretaryChad Wolfalso denied such knowledge.[324]^Clarifying his comments the next day, Trump said, \"A person was on a plane, said that there were about 6 people like that person, more or less, and what happened is the entire plane filled up with the looters, the anarchists, the rioters, people that obviously were looking for trouble. And the person felt very uncomfortable on the plane. This would be a person you would know.\"[329]References[edit]^Wagner, Meg; Alfonso III, Fernando; Macaya, Melissa; Mahtani, Melissa; Rocha, Veronica; Wills, Amanda (November 7, 2020).\"CNN Projection: Joe Biden Wins the Presidency\".CNN.Archivedfrom the original on November 17, 2020.

To track the evolving relationship between campaigning and governing, Doherty examines the strategic choices that presidents make and what those choices reveal about presidential priorities. He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president\\'s term in office\\xa0– illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff. He also shows how decisions about electoral matters previously made by party officials are now made by voter-conscious operatives within the White House.^Horwitz, Jeff (June 15, 2018).\"AP: Trump 2020 working with ex-Cambridge Analytica staffers\".The Washington Post.

In the early hours of November 6, after winning Pennsylvania and with a lead in Wisconsin, the Republican nominee declared victory in a 26-minutespeech. “I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47thpresident and your 45thpresident,” Trump said from his watch party in Florida. TheAssociated Pressofficially called the racefor the 78-year-old, who served as U.S. president from 2017 to 2021, hours later, after Trump won Wisconsin.As of November 7, the president-elect has earned 295 electoral votes to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ 226.Race resultsare still pending in Arizona and Nevada, but Trump has easily cleared the 270-vote threshold needed to win reelection. More than 72 million people and counting voted for the Republican.Trump reiterated key issues of his platform—immigration reform, U.S. energy production, slashing taxes and the national debt, and an “America first” ideology—during his victory speech. “To every citizen, I will fight for you and your family and your future,” Trump said. “I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve. This will truly be the golden age of America.” He also called for national unity.The president-elect thanked many people including: his wife,Melania Trump, and children; running mateJD Vanceand his wife,Usha Vance; his campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita; and prominent supporters such as billionaire entrepreneurElon Muskand UFC CEO Dana White. Trump also hinted at former 2024 presidential candidateRobert F. Kennedy Jr.’s role in his upcoming administration. “He’s going to help make America healthy again,” the once and future president said.He closed on a familiar note: “America’s future will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than it has ever been before.”Jump to:Who Is Donald Trump?Quick FactsYoung Donald Trump: Parents, Siblings, and EducationEntrepreneur and AuthorWealthWives and ChildrenPoliticianU.S. President2020 Presidential CampaignCriminal Indictments and TrialsSexual Assault and Rape Accusations2024 Presidential CampaignAssassination AttemptsTrump and ObamaComey and TrumpMueller Investigation of Donald TrumpTrump and Stormy DanielsMichael Cohen InvestigationPressuring Ukraine and Whistleblower ComplaintImpeachment and AcquittalCoronavirusSocial Media Executive OrderQuotesWho Is Donald Trump?Entrepreneur and politician Donald Trump served as the 45thpresident of the United States and won reelection in 2024. He will become the nation’s 47thpresident in January. Prior to his political career, the real estate developer took over his father’s middle-income housing business and transformed it into a global luxury brand that now includes hotels, golf courses, and commercial properties. Trump became a best-selling author with his 1987 bookThe Art of the Dealand a reality TV star in the 2000s onThe Apprentice. Despite his underdog status, Trump was elected president in November 2016, served one term from 2017 to 2021, then lost his reelection bid in 2020. The subject of numerous personal, business, and political scandals, Trump was convicted of falsifying business records in May 2024 and faces two additional criminal cases regarding election interference and the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.Quick FactsFULL NAME: Donald John TrumpBORN: June 14, 1946BIRTHPLACE: Queens, New YorkSPOUSES:Ivana Trump(1977-1992),Marla Maples(1993-1999), andMelania Trump(2005-present)CHILDREN:Donald Jr.,Ivanka,Eric,Tiffany, andBaronPARENTS: Frederick and Mary TrumpASTROLOGICAL SIGN: GeminiHEIGHT: 6 ft. 3 in.Young Donald Trump: Parents, Siblings, and EducationWhen and Where Was Donald Trump Born?Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in the New York City borough of Queens. He was the fourth of five children to parents Frederick Christ Trump Sr. and Mary Trump.Father and MotherFred Sr., Donald’s father, was also born and raised in New York City. His parents were German immigrants, though he claimed Swedish ancestry for decades after World War II. Fred Sr. cut his teeth as a real estate developer while still a teenager and later specialized in constructing and operating middle-income apartments in Queens and nearby Brooklyn.In 1930, Donald’s mother left her home in Tong, Scotland, for the United States as a 17-year-old named Mary Anne MacLeod. Soon after, she met Fred Sr., who was about seven years her senior. The couple married in 1936 and settled in Queens’ Jamaica neighborhood that was, at the time, filled with western European immigrants. Mary became an American citizen in 1942. As the family’s wealth increased in the 1950s thanks to the postwar real estate boom, she became a philanthropist.Fred Sr. died in 1999 followed by Mary one year later.SiblingsDonald grew up with two older sisters, an older brother, and a younger brother:Maryanne Trump Barry, born in April 1937, was a federal judge for 36 years, eventually serving as a senior judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. She took an inactive status soon after her brother became president then retired from the bench in February 2019 amid a judicial investigation into the Trump family’s tax practices that ended upon her retirement. Maryanne died at age 86 in November 2023.Fred Trump Jr., born in 1938 and known as “Freddy,” reluctantly joined his father’s real estate company, but his true passion was aviation. He left the family business for a time to become a TWA pilot before returning to real estate. Freddy’s struggle with alcoholism eventually led to his early death in 1981 at age 43, prompting Donald’s choice to abstain from alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs.Elizabeth Trump Grau, born in 1942, is a retired banker who is married to film producer James Grau.Robert Trump, born in August 1948, was Donald’s younger brother who spent much of his career working for the family company. He died in August 2020, aged 71.Education and ReligionThanks to his father’s business success, Donald enjoyed a life of luxury from a young age. Yet, the Trump children were also beholden to strict rules. Whereas Donald’s father was the hard-driving disciplinarian, his mother set the tone for his religious education. “My religious values were instilled in me by my mother,” Donald wrote in his bookGreat Again. He was raised Presbyterian and later attended Marble Collegiate Church, a Protestant house of worship led by Reverend Norman Vincent Peale at the time, and The Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea, an Episcopal congregation in Florida. Today, he identifies as anondenominational Christian. Trump took his first presidential oath of office with a bible his mother had given him in 1955 when he graduated Sunday school.Trump was known to test boundaries as a child, acknowledging this tendency in his bookThe Art of the Deal, “Even in elementary school, I was a very assertive, aggressive kid.” He laterdescribed himselfas “a bit of a troublemaker.” At age 13, Trump’s parents sent him to the New York Military Academy in upstate New York, hoping the discipline of the school would channel his energy in a positive manner. He did well at the academy, both socially and academically, rising to become a star athlete and student leader by the time he graduated in 1964.Later that year, Trump entered Fordham University. He transferred to the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania after two years and graduated in 1968 with a degree in economics. During his years at college, Trump worked at his father’s real estate business during the summer. He also secured education deferments for the draft for theVietnam Warand, ultimately, a 1-Y medical deferment after he graduated.Entrepreneur and AuthorGetty ImagesDonald Trump and his father, Fred, at the opening of Wollman Rink in 1987After college, Trump followed his father into a career in real estate development and brought his grander ambitions to the family business. He took over the company in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organizationtwo years later, and expanded the business conglomerate’s geographic footprint and overall scope to include hotels, golf courses, commercial properties, and more. One of the most well-known businessmen in America by the ’80s, Trump capitalized on his reputation to become a best-selling author and reality TV star onThe Apprenticeand its spinoff,Celebrity Apprentice. He was part-owner of the Miss USA, Miss Teen USA, and Miss Universe beauty pageantsfrom 1996 to 2015. When Trump became the president of the United States in January 2017, he relinquished management of The Trump Organization to his sonsDonald Trump Jr.andEric Trump.Trump OrganizationUnder Donald’s leadership, the Trump Organization began expanding into Manhattan real estate in the early 1970s. His first major commercial project was rehabbing the old Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt Hotel and restoring the exterior of neighboring Grand Central Station. To complete the project, Trump secured a 40-year property tax abatement deal, the first such agreement New York City made on a commercial property.A flurry of additional high-profile projects followed in the decade after the Grand Hyatt’s 1980 opening. Trump Tower, completed in 1983, combines luxury retail, residential, and office space. Trump Place, now owned by a Chicago-based company, replaced the West Side Rail Yards with 16 high-end residential buildings. The developer began renovations on the famous Plaza Hotel after purchasing it in 1988 (he sold it four years later). Outside of New York City, Trump expanded his company’s holdings into casinos via the Trump Plaza, Trump’s Castle (later renamed Trump Marina), and Trump Taj Mahal, all located in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Ultimately, the Trump Organization exited the casino business.Trump’s other business ventures over the years have included: golf courses in 10 American cities and five foreign countries, such as Trump International Golf Club; The Mar-a-Lago Club, his personal estate turned private club in Palm Beach, Florida; Trump University, a for-profit seminar series about real estate; an air-shuttle service; the New Jersey Generals, a team in the U.S. Football League; and numerous licensing deals of the Trump name.For all his successes, Trump has also experienced his share of failures. He has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize his business debtsix timesbetween 1991 and 2009. Four of the filings covered casinos the Trump Organization owned.BooksTrump has co-written more than 15 books, starting with 1987’sTrump: The Art of the Dealabout his tactics for successful business deals. TheNew York TimesNo. 1 bestseller soldmore than 1 million copies. His other books includeTrump: Surviving at the Top(1990),Trump: The Art of the Comeback(1997),Trump 101: The Way to Success(2007),Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again(2015), and most recentlyLetters to Trump(2023), featuring his private correspondence with celebrities, political leaders, and other public figures.Trump: The Art of the DealNow 61% Off$9 at AmazonThe ApprenticeIn January 2004, Trump became the star and an executive producer ofThe Apprentice, a reality competition show on NBC. Contestants vied for the chance to work for Trump, who became synonymous with his dismissal catchphrase, “You’re fired!” An immediate success,The Apprentice’s first season drew more than 20 million weekly viewers and earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Reality Competition Program. (In total,The Apprenticefranchise garnered nine Emmy nods, though it never won.)The series launched a spinoff,Celebrity Apprentice, in early 2008 that featured singerMeat Loaf, actorGeorge Takei, and boxerLaila Aliamong its many contestants who raised money for charity. Trump left the show in 2015, shortly after announcing his first presidential campaign, though he remained a producer for a follow-up season hosted byArnold Schwarzenegger.MoreCelebrity ApprenticeContestantsArsenio HallJoan RiversShawn JohnsonLawsuits and InvestigationsFair Housing Act Discrimination TrialIn October 1973, the federal government filed a complaint against Trump, his father, and their rental management company alleging that they had discriminated against tenants and potential tenants based on their race, a violation of theFair Housing Act, which is part of the 1968Civil Rights Act. The Trumps denied the claims and, after a lengthy legal battle, settled the case in June 1975 without admitting fault.As part of the settlement, the company had to train employees about the Fair Housing Act, inform the community about its fair housing practices, and devote some advertising of its rental vacancies to Black and Puerto Rican communities for a period of two years. It was also required to share race-based data of its renters and applicants in 16 buildings for a two-year period.Trump UniversityIn 2005, Trump launched his for-profit Trump University, offering classes in real estate and acquiring and managing wealth. The venture had been under scrutiny almost since its inception and at the time of his 2015 presidential bid, it remained the subject of multiple lawsuits.In the cases, claimants accused Trump of fraud, false advertising and breach of contract. Controversy about the suits made headlines when Trump suggested that U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel could not be impartial in overseeing two class action cases because of his Mexican heritage.On November 18, 2016, Trump, who had previously vowed to take the matter to trial, settled three of the lawsuits for $25 million without admission of liability. In a statement from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, he called the settlement, “a stunning reversal by Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.”Donald J. Trump FoundationLater, in a separate incident related to Trump University, it was reported that Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi decided not to join the existing New York fraud lawsuit. This came just days after she had received a sizable campaign donation from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which was founded in 1988 as a private charity organization designed to make donations to nonprofit groups. In November 2016, it was reported that Bondi\\'s name was on Trump\\'s list as a possible U.S. Attorney General contender.As a result of the improper donation to Bondi\\'s campaign, Trump was required to pay the IRS a penalty and his foundation came under scrutiny about the use of its funds for non-charitable activities. According to tax records, The Trump Foundation itself was found to have received no charitable gifts from Trump since 2008, and that all donations since that time had come from outside contributors.In fall 2019, after Trump admitted to misusing money raised by his foundation to promote his presidential campaign and settle debts, he was ordered to pay $2 million in damages, and the foundation was forced to shutter its doors.WealthOver the years, Trump’s net worth have been a subject of public debate. Because Trump has not publicly released his tax returns, it’s not possible to definitively determine his wealth in the past or today. However, Trump valued his businesses at least $1.37 billion on his 2017 federal financial disclosure form, published by the Office of Government Ethics. Trump’s 2018 disclosure form put his revenue for the year at a minimum of $434 million from all sources.In 1990, Trump asserted his own net worth in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion. At the time, the real estate market was in decline, reducing the value of and income from Trump\\'s empire. TheTrump Organizationrequired a massive infusion of loans to keep it from collapsing, a situation that raised questions as to whether the corporation could survive bankruptcy. Some observers saw Trump\\'s decline as symbolic of many of the business, economic and social excesses that had arisen in the 1980s.A May 2019investigation byThe New York Timesof 10 years of Trump’s tax information found that between 1985 and 1994, his businesses lost money every year. The newspaper calculated that Trump’s businesses suffered $1.17 billion in losses over the decade.Trump laterdefended himself on Twitter, calling theTimes’report “a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!” He tweeted that he reported “losses for tax purposes,” and that doing so was a “sport” among real estate developers.Wives and ChildrenDonald Trump has been married toMelania Trump, his third wife, for nearly 20 years. His ex-wives include the lateIvana TrumpandMarla Maples. Both marriages ended in divorce. The entrepreneur and politician is a father to three sons and two daughters.Ivana TrumpIn 1977, Trump married his first wife, Ivana Trump, a New York fashion model who had been an alternate on the 1972 Czech Olympic Ski Team. She was named vice president in charge of design in the Trump Organization and played a major role in supervising the renovation of the Commodore and the Plaza Hotel in New York City.The couple had three children together:Donald Trump Jr.,Ivanka, andEric. Ivana and Donald Sr. went through a highly publicized divorce that was finalized in 1992.Marla MaplesIn 1993, Trump married his second wife, Marla Maples, an actor with whom he had been involved for some time and already had a daughter,Tiffany.Trump ultimately filed for divorce from Maples in 1997. Widely covered by media outlets, their split was finalized in June 1999. A prenuptial agreement allotted $2 million to Maples.Melania TrumpTrump is currently married to former Slovenian model Melania Trump, who is more than 23 years his junior. In January 2005, the couple wed in a highly publicized and lavish wedding. Among the many celebrity guests at the wedding were Hillary Clinton and former PresidentBill Clinton. A year later, Donald and Melania welcomed their son,Barron.ChildrenPhoto: Davidoff Studios/Getty ImagesIvana Trump, Eric Trump, Donald Trump, and Ivanka Trump sit at a table at Mar-a-Lago in 1998.Trump has five children. He and his first wife,Ivana, had three kids together:Donald Trump Jr., born in December 1977;Ivanka Trump, born in October 1981; andEric Trump, born in January 1984. Donald and his second wife,Marla, had daughterTiffany Trumpin October 1993. His current wife,Melania, gave birth to Donald’s youngest child,Barron Trump, in March 2006.Trump’s sons Donald Jr. and Eric work as executive vice presidents for The Trump Organization. Donald Jr. joined the family business in 2001 followed by younger brother Eric six years later. In early 2017, the brothers took on their current leadership positions in The Trump Organization as their father began serving as president.Trump’s daughter Ivanka was also an executive vice president of The Trump Organization, having joined the business in 2005. Elsewhere, she worked with her dad onThe Apprenticeand became an entrepreneur with the creation of her eponymous fashion label. In 2017, Ivanka left The Trump Organization and her fashion brand, which closed a year later, to join her father’s presidential administration as an unpaid advisor. Her husband,Jared Kushner, similarly served as a senior adviser to President Trump.Donald Trump’s SonsDonald Trump Jr.Eric TrumpBarron TrumpSince the end of Donald’s presidential term in 2021, Ivanka and her husband have been much less involved in politics. However, Donald Jr. and Eric have increasingly contributed to their father’s political ambitions and arehonorary chairsof his 2024 transition team. Eric’s wife, Lara Trump, is also a prominent Republican leader since becoming the co-chair of the Republican National Committee in March 2024.Tiffany Trump largely grew up with her mother in southern California but maintained ties to her half-siblings and father. She attended Donald’s alma mater, University of Pennsylvania, for her undergraduate education before graduating from Georgetown University’s law school in 2020. She is expecting her first child with husband Michael Boulos.Donald Trump’s DaughtersIvanka TrumpTiffany TrumpBarron was the only one of Donald’s five children to live at the White House. He was 10 years old when his dad became president and moved to Washington D.C. in the summer of 2017 after completing the school year at his former New York City prep school. Now an adult, Barron is a student at New York University.In addition to his five children, the former president is also a grandfather. He has 10 grandchildren with another one on the way.PoliticianForApprenticefans and many others, Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign seemingly came out of nowhere. However, the business leader had shown an interest in politics decades earlier and even explored running for president on the Reform Party ticket in 2000. He decided against entering the race as candidate Pat Buchanan drummed up support among the third party’s base. A decade and a half later, Trump became one of the most recognizable politicians in the world.Political PartyTrump, a registered Republican, has done more to reshape his political party than anyone else in the past decade. He hasn’t always been a member of the GOP, though. In 1987, Trump registered as a Republican before becoming an Independent two years later. By 2000, the business leader was part of the Reform Party, which famously backed fellow entrepreneurRoss Perot’s presidential campaigns in the 1990s. In 2001, Trump registered as a Democrat.By 2009, Trump had switched back to the Republican party, though he registered as an Independent in 2011 to allow for a potential run in the following year’s presidential election. He finally returned to the Republican party to endorseMitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign and has remained a Republican since.Since his first ascension to the presidency in 2017, Trump has ushered in a more populist, more conservative identity to the Republican Party. His hard-line stance on immigration and “America first” ethos have been particularly well-received among voters. Many moderate Republicans in Congress and in other elected positions have lost primary races for not backing Trumpism, even after the former president’s term concluded in early 2021.2016 Presidential Campaign vs. Hillary ClintonPhoto: Pool/Getty ImagesHillary Clinton speaks as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump listens during the Presidential Debate at Hofstra University on September 26, 2016, in Hempstead, New York.In mid-June 2015, Trump announced he was running to be president of the United States as a Republican in the 2016 election. His platform included promises to renegotiate trade deals with American interests in mind, reduce taxes and government regulations, repeal the Affordable Care Act established under outgoing PresidentBarack Obama, defendSecond Amendmentgun rights, “rebuild our depleted military,” and curb illegal immigration, which he blamed for a variety of crimes. “We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities,” Trump said, describing his signature immigration policy idea.In an unorthodox move, the candidate repeatedly refused to release his tax returns while they were being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. It was the first time a major party candidate hadn’t released such information to the public before a presidential election sinceRichard Nixonin 1972.Initially considered a long-shot candidate in a crowded field that included experienced politicians likeJeb Bush,Ted Cruz, and Chris Christie, the famous businessman became the 2016 Republican nominee a little more than a year into his campaign. He faced DemocratHillary Clintonin the general election, and defying polls and media projections, Trump pulled off a stunning victory on November 8, 2016. Despite losing the popular vote to Clinton by almost 2.9 million votes, Trump’s electoral college win—306 votes to Clinton’s 232—sealed his triumph.After one of the most contentious presidential races in U.S. history, Trump’s rise to the White House was considered a resounding rejection of establishment politics by blue-collar and working-class Americans. Trump soon became the leader of the United States having never before held public office. Only former PresidentsZachary Taylor,Ulysses S. Grant, andDwight D. Eisenhowerwere similarly inexperienced at the time of their elections, though all had extensive military backgrounds.Tax ReturnsTrump’s net worth was questioned over the course of his 2016 presidential run, and he courted controversy after repeatedly refusing to release his tax returns while they were being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. He did not release his tax returns during the election, and he has not to date. It was the first time a major party candidate had not released such information to the public before a presidential election since Richard Nixon in 1972.After Democrats regained control of the House with the 2018 elections, Trump again faced calls to release his tax returns. In April 2019, Congressman Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, requested six years\\' worth of the president\\'s personal and business tax returns from the IRS. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin rejected the request, as well as Neal\\'s follow-up subpoena for the documents.In May the New York State Assembly passed legislation that authorized tax officials to release the president\\'s state returns to the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation for any \"specified and legitimate legislative purpose.\" With New York City serving as the home base for the Trump Organization, it was believed that the state returns would contain much of the same information as the president\\'s federal returns.In September 2019, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. subpoenaed the accounting firm Mazars USA for Trump\\'s personal and corporate tax returns dating back to 2011, prompting a challenge from the president\\'s lawyers. A Manhattan federal district judge dismissed Trump\\'s lawsuit in October, though the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit agreed to temporarily delay enforcement of the subpoena while considering arguments in the case. A few days later, that same appeals court rejected Trump\\'s bid to block another subpoena issued to Mazars USA, this one from the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.After the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments over whether the president could block the disclosure of his financial information to congressional committees and the Manhattan district attorney in December 2019, the cases were presented to the Court the following May.In September 2020,The New York Timesreported that Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, and paid nothing in income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years. A lawyer for the Trump Organization replied that \"most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate\" in theTimesreport.U.S. PresidentOn January 20, 2017, Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States by Supreme Court Chief JusticeJohn Roberts. In his inaugural speech, Trump shared a populist, and at times bleak, message. “What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people,” he said. “January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.” He described an America that had failed many of its citizens, on account of families trapped in poverty, an ineffective education system, crime, drugs, and gangs. “This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,” he said.Photo: Rob Carr/Getty ImagesDonald Trump dances with wife Melania Trump at the Liberty Inaugural Ball on January 20, 2017, in Washington, D.C.In his term as president, Trump issued executive orders to make good on some of his campaign promises as well as several orders aimed at deregulation. His administration saw the implementation of a number of controversial immigration policies, including a travel ban for several predominantly Muslim countries; the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership; scaled back financial regulations and environmental protections; and Trump’s appointment of threeSupreme Court justices.The president proposed a budget with increased spending for the military, veterans affairs, and national security, including building a wall on the border with Mexico, as well as major cuts to government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Endowment for the Arts. One of his most significant monetary accomplishments was signing a 2017 tax bill into law that lowered taxes for individuals and corporations.At various points during the Trump administration, the president and some members of his staff were embroiled in controversy or the subject of federal investigations. The Mueller investigation examined Russian interference into the 2016 election and the foreign country’s possible, but ultimately unfounded, ties to the Trump campaign. Trump was impeached twice: for abuse of power and obstructing Congress in 2019 related to a campaign scandal involving Ukraine, then for incitement of insurrection in 2021 related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol. In both instances, the Senate voted against the president’s removal from office.Elsewhere, citizens protested against Trump’s policies and stance on major issues, including immigration, climate change, and women’s rights. TheWomen’s March, held the day after the president’s inauguration, became thelargest single-day protest in U.S. historywith more than half a million people participating in Washington D.C. and hundreds of thousands more demonstrating across the country.Read more about Trump’s accomplishments and other events during his presidential term, which ended in January 2021, below:Supreme Court AppointeesTrump nominated three Supreme Court Justices—Neil Gorsuch,Brett Kavanaugh, andAmy Coney Barrett—who were all confirmed by the U.S. Senate to the nation’s highest court. The newest appointees have conservative-leaning ideologies, cementing the current conservative majority of the Supreme Court.Less than two weeks after assuming office, the president nominated Neil Gorsuch to replaceAntonin Scalia. The late justice’s seat had been empty since his February 2016 death with Senate Republicans having denied a confirmation hearing to PresidentBarack Obama’s nominee. After Gorsuch testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 2017, Democrats blocked his appointment in the first successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. In another historic move, Republicans lowered the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority of 50. Early that April, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch’s appointment, and he became the 113th justice of the Supreme Court.In July 2018, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh ahead of JusticeAnthony Kennedy’s retirement at the end of the month. A textualist and originalist in the mold of Scalia, the nomination continued the rightward push of the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh’s path to becoming a justice was nearly derailed by accusations of sexual assault. However, he earned confirmation in a close vote that October.Following the death of JusticeRuth Bader Ginsburgin September 2020, Trump quickly nominated Amy Coney Barrett. One month later, the Senate voted to confirm Barrett, who became the fifth woman to serve on the Supreme Court.Tax ReformJust before the end of his first 100 days, in late April 2017, Trump announced his tax plan in a one-page outline that would dramatically change tax codes. The plan called for streamlining seven personal income tax brackets to three—10, 25, and 35 percent—lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent, eliminating the alternative minimum tax and estate tax, and simplifying the process for filing tax returns.On December 2, 2017, Trump achieved the first major legislative victory of his administration when the Senate passed a sweeping tax reform bill. Approved along party lines by a 51-49 vote, the bill drew criticism for extensive last-minute rewrites, with frustrated Democrats posting photos of pages filled with crossed-out text and handwriting crammed into the margins.Among other measures, the Senate bill called for the slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, doubling personal deductions, and ending the Obamacare mandate. It also included a controversial provision that allowed for “unborn children” to be named as beneficiaries of college savings accounts, which critics called an attempt to support the pro-life movement. Despite estimates by the Congressional Budget Office that the bill would cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, GOP senators insisted that charges would be offset by a growing economy.After the bill\\'s passage, Trump tweeted: “Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now, these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment!” On December 20, the final tax bill formally passed both chambers of Congress.Following partisan battles over a spending bill in early 2018, which resulted in a brief government shutdown and stopgap measures, Trump threatened to torpedo a $1.3 trillion spending bill with a last-minute veto. Reportedly angry that the bill did not fully fund his long-promised Mexican border wall, he nevertheless signed the bill into law on March 23, hours before another government shutdown would have gone into effect.Climate ChangeDuring the 2016 presidential election, Trump called climate change a “hoax.” He later recanted, saying, \"I don\\'t think it\\'s a hoax, I think there\\'s probably a difference.\"However, in an October 2018 interview onFox News,Trump accused climate scientists of having a “political agenda” and said that he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for rising temperatures.In November 2018,The Fourth National Climate Assessment, compiled by 13 federal agencies including the EPA and Department of Energy, found that, left unchecked, climate change would be catastrophic for the U.S. economy. Trump told reporters, \"I don\\'t believe it.\"In June 2019, Trump met with then-Prince Charlesand reportedly discussed climate change at length. In an interview with British TV host Piers Morgan, Trump said \"I believe that there is a change in weather and I think it changes both ways...It used to be called global warming, that wasn\\'t working, then it was called climate change and now actually it is called extreme weather.\"Trump later told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that he pushed back Prince Charles’ suggestions that the United States do more to combat climate change, saying that the U.S. “now has among the cleanest climates there are based on all statistics.”Paris Climate AgreementOn June 1, 2017, Trump withdrew from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which President Obama had joined along with the leaders of 195 other countries. The accord requires all participating nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to curbclimate changeover the ensuing century and also to allocate resources for the research and development of alternative energy sources.With Trump’s decision, the United States joined Syria and Nicaragua as the only three countries to reject the accord. However, Nicaragua eventually joined the Paris Climate Agreement months later.Oil ExtractionSoon after taking office, Trump revived the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines to transfer oil extracted in Canada and North Dakota. The pipelines had been halted by President Obama following protests from environmental and Native American groups.Trump owned shares of Energy Transfer Partners, the company in charge of construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, but sold his stake in the company in December 2016. Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren also contributed to Trump’s presidential campaign, raising concerns over conflict of interest.Coal MiningOn March 28, 2017, the president, surrounded by American coal miners, signed the \"Energy Independence\" executive order, calling for the Environmental Protection Agency to roll back Obama\\'s Clean Power Plan, curb climate and carbon emissions regulations and to rescind a moratorium on coal mining on U.S. federal lands.Endangered Species ActIn August 2019, the Trump administration announced it was overhauling the Endangered Species Act. This included changes to legislation that gave the government increased discretion over matters of climate change and economic cost when determining whether a species should be protected.Photo: Scott Olson/Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump addressing a crowdHealth CareOne of Trump’s first executive orders in office was calling on federal agencies to \"waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay\" aspects of the Affordable Care Act to minimize financial burden on states, insurers and individuals.On March 7, 2017, House Republicans, led by SpeakerPaul Ryan, introduced the American Health Care Act, a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, the controversial bill ultimately didn\\'t have enough Republican votes and was withdrawn a few weeks later, representing a major legislative setback for Speaker Ryan and Trump.After intense negotiations among party factions, a new Republican health care plan was brought to a vote in the House of Representatives on May 4, 2017, and passed by a slim margin of 217 to 213. That passed the buck to the Senate.Almost immediately after a draft was unveiled on June 22, conservative senators such as Ted Cruz declared they could not support the bill\\'s failure to significantly lower premiums, while moderates like Susan Collins voiced concerns over its steep cuts to Medicaid. On June 27, Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnellelected to delay his planned vote for the bill. When the third, so-called “skinny repeal,” bill finally went to a vote on in the Senate July 28, it failed by three votes.In September, a new bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act was put forth by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. However, on September 26, Senate Republicans announced they would not move forward with the current plan, as they were short of the required votes. “We are disappointed in certain so-called Republicans,” Trump responded.On October 12, 2017 Trump signed an executive order in a move that could dismantle the ACA without Congress’s approval, expanding health insurance products — mostly less comprehensive plans through associations of small employers and more short-term medical coverage.He also announced that he would get rid of health insurance subsidies. Known as cost-sharing reduction payments, which lower the cost of deductibles for low-income Americans, they were expected to cost $9 billion in 2018 and $100 billion over the next decade.Birth Control MandateOn October 6, 2017, the Trump administration announced a rollback of the birth control mandate put in place by the Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act, which required insurers to cover birth control at no cost without copayments as a preventive service. For years, the mandate was threatened by lawsuits from conservative and religious groups.The Trump administration said the new exemption applied to any employer that objects to covering contraception services on the basis of “sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.” The change is in line with Trump’s promises as a candidate to ensure that religious groups “are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs.”Opponents of the measure said that it could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of women and that access to affordable contraception in the mandate provided prevents unintended pregnancies and saves women’s lives.AbortionAs president, Trump has said that he is “strongly pro-life” and wants to ban all abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is in danger. He has supported bans on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and has cited his appointments of conservative Supreme Court judges Gorsuch and Kavanaugh as helping to make abortion laws in some states more restrictive.Trump changed his beliefs on abortion from pro-choice to anti-abortion in 1999. In 2016, he said that he supported “some form of punishment” for women who undergo abortions; he later released a statement saying he only thought practitioners should be punished for performing abortions, not women for having them.In January 2020, after his administration threatened to cut federal funds to California over a mandate that the state\\'s health insurance plans cover abortion, Trump became the first sitting president to address the annual March for Life rally in Washington, D.C.Transgender RightsOn February 22, 2017, the Trump administration rolled back federal protection for transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity, allowing states and school districts to interpret federal anti-discrimination law.On March 27, 2017, Trump signed several measures under the Congressional Review Act to reverse regulations related to education, land use and a \"blacklisting rule\" requiring federal contractors to disclose violations of federal labor, wage and workplace safety laws.Later that year, the president tweeted that he would enact a ban on transgender people from serving in the military. The official policy went into effect the following March with the statement that \"transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria — individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery — are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances.\"Following a legal challenge, the Supreme Court allowed the ban to go into effect in January 2019, while allowing lower courts to hear additional arguments.Gun ControlTrump has vowed to defend the Second Amendment and gun ownership since taking office. He spoke at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention in 2019, and he promised to veto a measure passed in February 2019 by House Democrats to strengthen background checks. However, Trump has also at times said he would be willing to consider a range of measures to restrict gun access. His administration also banned bump stocks in October 2017 after a mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival left 58 people dead.The Valentine\\'s Day 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which left a total of 17 students and faculty dead, sparked a strong response from Trump.He ordered the Justice Department to issue regulations banning bump stocks and suggested he was willing to consider a range of measures, from strengthening background checks to raising the minimum age for buying rifles. He also backed an NRA-fueled proposal for arming teachers, which drew backlash from many in the profession.The president remained invested in the issue even as the usual cycle of outrage began diminishing: In a televised February 28 meeting with lawmakers, he called for gun control legislation that would expand background checks to gun shows and internet transactions, secure schools and restrict sales for some young adults.At one point he called out Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey for being \"afraid of the NRA,\" and at another, he suggested that authorities should seize guns from mentally ill or other potentially dangerous people without first going to court. \"I like taking the guns early,\" he said. \"Take the guns first, go through due process second.\"His stances seemingly stunned the Republican lawmakers at the meeting, as well as the NRA, which previously considered the president as a strong supporter. Within a few days, Trump was walking back his proposal to raise the age limit and mainly pushing for arming select teachers.In June 2019, Trump said he would “think about” a ban on gun silencers following the deaths of a dozen people, who were killed by a gunman at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center. Two months later, after back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, the president suggested tying expanded background checks to immigration reform legislation.Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesDonald Trump gives two thumbs up to the crowd on the fourth day of the Republican National Convention on July 21, 2016, at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.Trump and MexicoBorder WallTrump issued an executive order to build a wall at the United States’ border with Mexico. In his first televised interview as president, Trump said the initial construction of the wall would be funded by U.S. taxpayer dollars, but that Mexico would reimburse the U.S. “100 percent” in a plan to be negotiated and might include a suggested import tax on Mexican goods.In response to the new administration\\'s stance on a border wall, Mexican PresidentEnrique Peña Nietocanceled a planned visit to meet with Trump. \"Mexico does not believe in walls,\" the Mexican president said in a video statement. \"I\\'ve said time again; Mexico will not pay for any wall.\"After funding for the wall failed to materialize, from either Mexico or Congress, Trump in April 2018 announced that he would reinforce security along the U.S. border with Mexico by using American troops because of the \"horrible, unsafe laws\" that left the country vulnerable. The following day, the president signed a proclamation that directed National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.The Department of Homeland Security said that the deployment would be in coordination with governors, that the troops would \"support federal law enforcement personnel, including [Customs and Border Protection],\" and that federal immigration authorities would \"direct enforcement efforts.\"In December 2018, shortly before a newly elected Democratic majority was set to take control of the House, Trump announced he would not sign a bill to fund the government unless Congress allocated $5.7 billion toward building his long-promised border wall. With Democrats refusing to give in to his demand, a partial government shutdown ensued for a record 35 days, until all sides agreed to another attempt at striking a compromise.On February 14, 2019, one day before the deadline, Congress passed a $333 billion spending package that allocated $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel-post fencing. After indicating that he would sign the bill, the President made good on his threat to declare a national emergency the following day, enabling him to funnel $3.6 billion slated for military construction projects toward building the wall.In response, a coalition of 16 states filed a lawsuit that challenged Trump\\'s power to circumvent Congress on this issue.\"Contrary to the will of Congress, the president has used the pretext of a manufactured \\'crisis\\' of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency and redirect federal dollars appropriated for drug interdiction, military construction and law enforcement initiatives toward building a wall on the United States-Mexico border,\" the lawsuit said.After the House voted for a resolution to overturn the national emergency declaration in late February, the Senate followed suit on March 14 when 12 Republican senators joined a united Democratic side to vote for the resolution. Trump promptly issued the first veto of his presidency the following day, calling the resolution a \"vote against reality.\"In late July 2019, the Supreme Court overturned an appellate decision and ruled that the Trump administration could begin using Pentagon money for construction during the ongoing litigation over the issue.Border Separation PolicyAs part of attempts to seal the U.S. border with Mexico, the Trump administration in 2018 began following through on a \"zero-tolerance\" policy to prosecute anybody found to have crossed the border illegally. As children were legally not allowed to be detained with their parents, this meant that they were to be held separately as family cases wound through immigration courts.A furor ensued after reports surfaced that nearly 2,000 children had been separated from their parents over a six-week period that ended in May 2018, compounded by photos of toddlers crying in cages. Trump initially deflected blame for the situation, insisting it resulted from the efforts of predecessors and political opponents. \"The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda,\" he tweeted.The president ultimately caved to pressure from the bad PR, and on June 20 he signed an executive order that directed the Department of Homeland Security to keep families together.\"I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated,\" he said, adding that it remained important to have \"zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally\" and for Congress to find a permanent solution to the problem. In the meantime, the DHS essentially revived the \"catch-and-release\" system that the zero-tolerance policy was meant to eradicate while dealing with the logistics of reuniting families.Travel BanPresident Trump signed one of his most controversial executive orders on January 27, 2017, calling for \"extreme vetting\" to \"keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America.\" The president\\'s executive order was put into effect immediately, and refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries traveling to the U.S. were detained at U.S. airports.The order called for a ban on immigrants from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for at least 90 days, temporarily suspended the entry of refugees for 120 days and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely. In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump also said he would give priority to Christian refugees trying to gain entry into the United States.After facing multiple legal hurdles, Trump signed a revised executive order on March 6, 2017, calling for a 90-day ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries including Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Iraq, which was included in the original executive order, was removed from the list.Travelers from the six listed countries, who hold green cards or have valid visas as of the signing of the order, will not be affected. Religious minorities would not get special preference, as was outlined in the original order, and an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees was reduced to 120 days.On March 15, just hours before the revised ban was going to be put into effect, Derrick Watson, a federal judge in Hawaii, issued a temporary nationwide restraining order in a ruling that stated the executive order did not prove that a ban would protect the country from terrorism and that it was “issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion, in spite of its stated, religiously neutral purpose.” At a rally in Nashville, Trump responded to the ruling, saying: \"This is, in the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.”Judge Theodore D. Chuang of Maryland also blocked the ban the following day, and in subsequent months, the ban was impeded in decisions handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, and the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals once again.However, on June 26, 2017, Trump won a partial victory when the Supreme Court announced it was allowing the controversial ban to go into effect for foreign nationals who lacked a \"bona fide relationship with any person or entity in the United States.\" The court agreed to hear oral arguments for the case in October, but with the 90-to-120-day timeline in place for the administration to conduct its reviews, it was believed the case would be rendered moot by that point.On September 24, 2017, Trump issued a new presidential proclamation, which permanently bans travel to the United States for most citizens from seven countries. Most were on the original list, including Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, while the new order included Chad, North Korea and some citizens of Venezuela (certain government officials and their families). The tweak did little to pacify critics, who argued that the order was still heavily biased toward Islam.“The fact that Trump has added North Korea — with few visitors to the U.S. — and a few government officials from Venezuela doesn’t obfuscate the real fact that the administration’s order is still a Muslim ban,” said Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.On October 10, the Supreme Court canceled a planned hearing on an appeal of the original travel ban. On October 17, the day before the order was to take effect, Judge Watson of Hawaii issued a nationwide order freezing the Trump administration’s new travel ban, writing that the order was a “poor fit for the issues regarding the sharing of ‘public-safety and terrorism-related information that the president identifies.”On December 4, 2017, the Supreme Court allowed the third version of the Trump administration’s travel ban to go into effect despite the ongoing legal challenges. The court’s orders urged appeals courts to determine as quickly as possible whether the ban was lawful.Under the ruling, the administration could fully enforce its new restrictions on travel from eight nations, six of them predominantly Muslim. Citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, along with some groups of people from Venezuela, would be unable to emigrate to the United States permanently, with many barred from also working, studying or vacationing in the country.On June 26, 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the president\\'s travel ban by a 5-4 vote. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said that Trump had the executive authority to make national security judgments in the realm of immigration, regardless of his previous statements about Islam. In a sharply worded dissent, JusticeSonia Sotomayorsaid that the outcome was equivalent to that ofKorematsu v. United States, which permitted the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\\'Public Charge\\' RuleIn August 2019, the Trump administration unveiled a new regulation designed to weed out immigrants who would potentially require government assistance. Known as the \"public charge\" rule, for people who are dependent on Medicaid, food stamps and other benefits, the policy tightened requirements for legal immigrants seeking to become permanent residents by focusing on factors like education, assets, resources and financial status.Trump and North KoreaNuclear Weapons and Economic SanctionsIn early August 2017, intelligence experts confirmed that North Korea successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that fits inside its missiles, putting it one step closer to becoming a nuclear power. Around the same time, the North Korean state news agency said they were \"examining the operational plan\" to strike areas around the U.S. territory of Guam with medium-to-long-range strategic ballistic missiles.U.S. experts estimated North Korea’s nuclear warheads at 60 and that the country could soon have an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States. Trump responded that North Korea would be met with “fire and fury” if the threats continued and that the U.S. military was “locked and loaded.”On August 15, Korean leaderKim Jong-unsaid he’d \"watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees,\" which Trump tweeted was “a very wise and well reasoned decision.” However on August 20, North Korea warned that the U.S. was risking an \"uncontrollable phase of a nuclear war\" by following through with military drills withSouth Korea.On August 28, North Korea launched a missile over Japan. The following day, Trump said “all options were on the table.” At the United Nations General Assembly on September 19, Trump pejoratively called Kim Jong-un “Rocketman” and said he would “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies, hours after the group voted to enact additional sanctions against the country.Two days later, Trump widened American economic sanctions; three days later North Korea threatened to shoot down American airplanes even if they were not in its airspace, calling Trump’s comments “a declaration of war.” A week later, Secretary of StateRex Tillersonsaid the U.S. and North Korea were in “direct communication” and looking for a non-militarized path forward.On October 20, CIA DirectorMike Pompeowarned that North Korea was in the \"final step\" of being able to strike mainland America with nuclear warheads and the U.S. should react accordingly. Some foreign policy experts were concerned that war between the U.S. and North Korea was increasingly possible.Summits With Kim Jong-unFollowing the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, during which North Korea made a show of unity with the host country, its officials also relayed interest in opening up communications with Washington. Trump leaped at the opportunity, announcing that he was willing to sit down with Kim.On June 12, 2018, Trump and Kim met at the secluded Capella resort in Singapore, marking the first such encounter between a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader. The two held private talks with their interpreters, before expanding the meeting to include such top staffers as Pompeo (now U.S. secretary of state), National Security Adviser John Bolton and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.Afterward, in a televised ceremony, the leaders signed a joint statement in which Trump \"committed to provide security guarantees\" to North Korea and Kim \"reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" Although their talks marked an early step in a diplomatic process that some predicted could take years to complete, the president said he believed denuclearization on the peninsula would begin \"very quickly.\"\"We\\'re very proud of what took place today,\" Trump said. \"I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past.\"On February 27, 2019, the two men met for a second summit, at the Metropole hotel in Hanoi, Vietnam, to discuss the next steps in denuclearization. Said Trump to his counterpart: \"I think you will have a tremendous future with your country — a great leader. And I look forward to watching it happen and helping it to happen.\"However, negotiations abruptly ended the second day, after North Korea reportedly asked for sanctions to be lifted in exchange for dismantling its main nuclear facility but not all elements of its weapons program. \"Sometimes you have to walk,\" the president said, before adding that things concluded on good terms.On June 30, 2019, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea when he met with Kim for informal discussions at the Demilitarized Zone between the two countries on the Korean peninsula. Trump later said that he and Kim had agreed to designate negotiators to resume denuclearization talks in the coming weeks.Photo: Rick Friedman/rickfriedman.com/Corbis via Getty ImagesDonald Trump speaking at a campaign rally at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, New Hampshire on August 14, 2015Trump and RussiaRussian Hacking in the 2016 ElectionThroughout the 2016 presidential election, Trump vehemently denied allegations he had a relationship with Russian PresidentVladimir Putinand was tied to the hacking of the DNC emails.In January 2017, a U.S. intelligence report prepared by theCIA,FBIand NSA concluded that Putin had ordered a campaign to influence the U.S. election. “Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,\" the report said.Prior to the release of the report, President-elect Trump had cast doubt on Russian interference and the intelligence community’s assessment. Trump received an intelligence briefing on the matter, and in his first press conference as president-elect on January 11, he acknowledged Russia’s interference.However, in subsequent comments he again refused to condemn Russia for such activity, notably saying on multiple occasions that he believed Putin\\'s denials.In March 2018, the Trump administration formally acknowledged the charges by issuing sanctions on 19 Russians for interference in the 2016 presidential election and alleged cyberattacks. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin delivered the announcement, with the president remaining silent on the matter.In July, days before Trump was to meet with Putin in Finland, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced additional charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking the DNC and the Clinton campaign.Meeting With PutinThe White House announced that Trump would hold his first formal discussions with Russian President Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018.The two men met on the heels of Trump\\'s heavily scrutinized summit withNATOleaders, and shortly after the Justice Department announced the indictment of 12 Russian operatives for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Prompted to address the issue of election hacking in a joint news conference for the two leaders, Trump refused to point a finger at his counterpart. \"I think we\\'ve all been foolish. I think we\\'re all to blame,\" he said, adding that \"President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.\"The comments drew a harsh response stateside, with several notable Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues to question why the president was siding with Putin over his intelligence agencies. Senator McCain called it \"one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory,\" and even Trump ally Newt Gingrich weighed in with strong words, tweeting, \"It is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected — immediately.\"Trump sought to quiet the furor after returning to the White House, insisting that he had misspoken when saying he didn\\'t see why Russia should be blamed and reminding that he has \"on numerous occasions noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections,\" though he again suggested that other parties could be responsible.Around that time, it was revealed that Trump had instructed Bolton, his national security adviser, to invite Putin to the White House that autumn, news that caught Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats off guard. Bolton soon disclosed that he would postpone the invitation until the conclusion of the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Russian SanctionsDespite Trump\\'s overtures to Putin, his administration in February 2019 announced the suspension of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, due to the Eastern power\\'s repeated violations of the agreement. The announcement gave Russia 180 days to comply with terms before U.S. withdrawal from the treaty would be completed.SyriaOn April 6, 2017, Trump ordered a military strike, to which he had tweeted opposition to when Obama was in office, on a Syrian government airfield. The strike was in response to a chemical attack by Syrian presidentBashar al-Assadon Syrian civilians that had led to the horrific deaths of dozens of men, women and children.Navy destroyers fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at Shayrat airfield, from where the attack was launched. It was the first direct military action by the United States against Syrian military forces during the country\\'s ongoing civil war.One year later, evidence surfaced of another chemical attack on Syrians, with dozens reported dead in the rebel-held city of Douma. Although Syria and its ally, Russia, referred to the situation as a \"hoax\" perpetrated by terrorists, Trump wasn\\'t having it: \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming,\" he tweeted, adding, \"You shouldn\\'t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\"The U.S. subsequently joined forces with Britain and France for coordinated strikes on Syria early in the morning of April 14, 2018. Larger than the previous year\\'s operation, this one hit two chemical weapons facilities and a scientific research center. Afterward, the president took to Twitter to thank his military allies for their efforts, declaring, \"Mission Accomplished!\"In December 2018, Trump announced that U.S. military troops would be pulled from Syria, before changing his mind when that decision was denounced as one that would primarily benefit Assad and his government\\'s main ally, Russia. However, the president reversed course again the following October by ordering U.S. troops withdrawn from northeast Syria to clear the way for a Turkish military operation, one that could threaten American-backed Kurdish insurgents in the area.Again drawing a sharp response from critics, the president made his case on Twitter by arguing it was time to get out of Syria and let other nations in the region \"figure the situation out,\" adding that he would respond forcefully if Turkey did anything \"off limits.\" Shortly afterward, he announced he was imposing sanctions on Turkey for a military offensive that was \"endangering civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region.\"Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesDonald TrumpDeath of Abu Bakr al-BaghdadiIn late October 2019, Trump announced that the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was dead following a daring American commando raid in Syria. According to the president, the militant leader was chased to the end of an underground tunnel, \"whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\" before detonating a suicide vest. The announcement came amid the controversy over the withdrawal of troops from the region, with critics pointing to the American military presence and intelligence contributions from Kurdish allies as factors that led to the success of the mission.Trade WarOn March 1, 2018, after the conclusion of a Commerce Department investigation, Trump announced that he was imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum. He ultimately granted temporary exemptions as he sought to renegotiate deals.His actions resulted in new agreements with South Korea and multiple South American countries to restrain their metal exports. Talks with China, the E.U. and the border countries stalled. In late May, the administration announced that it was moving forward with all tariffs.The move drew a harsh response from the E.U., Canada and Mexico, which announced retaliatory measures. With Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeaucondemning Trump\\'s \"unacceptable actions\" and French PresidentEmmanuel Macronthreatening to isolate the U.S. from the Group of 7, the president faced a frosty reception at the G-7 summit in Quebec in June.He ultimately left the summit early, making headlines on the way out by announcing he would not sign a communique between the seven nations and taking shots at Trudeau on Twitter. In July, Trump again had harsh words for allies at the NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, including accusations that Germany was \"captive\" to Russia for its dependence on Russian natural gas, and followed with criticism of U.K. Prime MinisterTheresa Mayfor her handling of Brexit.Back home, the president attempted to head off the political fallout of a potentially costly trade war with the announcement that the administration would provide up to $12 billion in emergency relief funds for U.S. farmers. The following summer, the administration revealed details for a new, $16 billion aid package for struggling farmers.ChinaIn April 2018, the Trump administration announced it was adding a 25 percent tariff on more than 1,000 Chinese products to penalize the country for its trade practices. He granted temporary exemptions to negotiate a deal. In late May, he moved forward with a tax on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods that went into effect in July.The trade war with China escalated in May 2019, when the president gave the go-ahead to raise tariffs to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. The increase came as the two countries were attempting to hammer out terms for a new trade deal.The following month, after Trump used the threat of tariffs to obtain expanded border-security measures from Mexico, the president turned his attention back to China with the suggestion that another $300 billion in Chinese goods would be taxed should trade talks continue to stall. He announced a 5 percent hike in late August and threatened another 5 percent increase by October, before agreeing to delay the latter as he continued to push for an all-encompassing trade deal.In October, the president gushed about the \"very substantial phase one deal\" reached with China, saying a final agreement on matters related to intellectual property, financial services and agriculture would take three to five weeks to put in place. Signed in mid-January 2020, the deal included commitments from China to purchase an additional $200 billion of U.S. products over the next two years and to refrain from currency manipulation and intellectual property theft.TaiwanIn June 2019, Trump announced that the U.S. would be selling more than $2 billion in tanks and military equipment to Taiwan, one of its largest sales in recent years. The move added tension to China’s relationship with the U.S. The U.S. is the largest supplier of arms to Taiwan, which could help stave off an eventual invasion of Taiwan by the Chinese military.The U.S. does not officially recognize Taiwan, a de facto independent island that the communist Chinese government plans to bring back under its control, with force if necessary. However, U.S. officials see Taiwan as an important counterweight to China in the region and have expressed concern about China’s actions toward Taiwan. In 2018, to the ire of Chinese officials, the Pentagon began ordering naval ships to sail through the Taiwan Strait as a show of military power.Israel and the Recognition of JerusalemOn December 6, 2017, Trump announced that the U.S. was formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital ofIsrael, and would move the American embassy there from its current location in Tel Aviv. The declaration broke decades of precedent, in which the U.S. refused to take sides in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians over territorial rights to the city.Fulfilling one of his campaign pledges, Trump referred to the move as \"a long overdue step to advance the peace process,\" noting it \"would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result.\" He also stressed that the move would not interfere with any proposals for a two-state solution.The announcement was praised by Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahubut not as warmly received by American allies France, Britain and Germany, which called it disruptive to the peace process. Leaders of the predominantly Muslim countries Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon all condemned the move, while Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the U.S. could no longer be considered a mediator in the region.On December 21, the U.N. General Assembly voted 128 to 9 to demand that the U.S. rescind its formal recognition of Jerusalem. Britain, France, Germany and Japan all voted for the resolution, though others, like Australia and Canada, abstained from the symbolic vote.After dispatching Vice PresidentMike Penceto help smooth things over with Arab leaders in the Middle East, Trump sought to reestablish ties with American allies at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2018. He praised U.K. Prime Minister May and enjoyed a friendly meeting with Netanyahu, though he also took a shot at the Palestinian Authority for refusing to meet with Pence.Continuing with a recalibrated approach to relations with its Middle Eastern ally, the Trump administration announced in November 2019 that it no longer considered Israeli settlements in the West Bank to be illegal under international law.A few weeks later, the president sought to bolster support among American Jews by signing an executive order aimed at cracking down on anti-Semitism at college campuses. The order effectively allowed the government to recognize Judaism as both a race or nationality and religion, empowering the Education Department to withhold funding from college or educational programs accused of discriminatory actions against Jews.In January 2020, Trump revealed his \"deal of the century\" proposal for a two-state solution. His plan envisioned Jerusalem remaining the capital of Israel, with Palestinians getting their own capital in the eastern part of the city, and the authority for Israel to move forward with annexing its West Bank settlements. The proposal was quickly rejected by Palestinians, with Abbas dismissing it as the \"slap of the century.\" In September 2020, Trump presided over the signing of accords between Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, in which the two Arab countries normalized relations with Israel.IranIn May 2018, over the objections of European allies, Trump announced that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal enacted by his predecessor and reimposing sanctions on the Middle Eastern country.The announcement initially drew a tepid response from Iran, but President Hassan Rouhani had stronger words on the issue while addressing diplomats in July, noting that \"war with Iran is the mother of all wars\" and warning his American counterpart to \"not play with the lion\\'s tail, because you will regret it eternally.\"That seemingly enraged Trump, who fired off an all-caps tweet addressed to Rouhani: \"Never, ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before,\" he wrote. \"We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence & death. Be cautious!\"Tensions mounted again by April 2019, when the Trump administration announced it would no longer grant economic exemptions to the five countries — China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey — which had been permitted to buy oil from Iran. Several oil tankers were subsequently attacked near the Strait of Hormuz, with the U.S. holding Iran responsible for the brazen actions.In June 2019, the Iranian military shot down an American drone over contested airspace. Trump said he was minutes away from ordering a strike in retaliation, before electing to impose new sanctions instead.In late December, after an American civilian contractor was killed in a rocket attack on an Iraqi base, the U.S. carried out military strikes against an Iranian-backed militia deemed responsible for the attack. After protesters responded by breaching the outer wall of the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, the animosity escalated with the death of General Qassem Soleimani, Iran\\'s top security and intelligence commander, in a drone strike authorized by President Trump.Cuba and Travel RestrictionsTo pressure Cuba’s communist government to reform and end its support for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Trump tightened travel restrictions to Cuba in April 2019.In June 2019, Trump announced that the State Department would no longer allow private or public ships and aircraft to visit Cuba. The U.S. will also no longer allow “people-to-people” educational travel, which previously proved to be a popular travel exemption. Tourist groups may still be able to get around the ban by applying one of the other 11 travel exemptions that are still allowed. In September 2020, Trump announced new sanctions aimed at curtailing U.S. travel to Cuba.President Obama loosened travel restrictions to Cuba following decades of detente between the countries, initiating a short-lived travel boom to the area.Charlottesville RallyOn August 12, 2017, a group of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virgina, gathered for a “Unite the Right” rally to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate generalRobert E. Lee. People in favor of removing the statue felt that it was a symbol implicitly endorsing white supremacy, while the protesters believed removing it was an attempt at erasing history.The rally attractedKu Klux Klanand neo-Nazis, including former KKK leader David Duke, who told reporters that the protesters were “going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump” to “take our country back.”When counter-protesters arrived, the demonstration turned violent with racial slurs, pushing and brawling. Then a car, driven by a man who appeared to show marching earlier that day alongside Neo-Nazis in aCNNphoto plowed into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old counter-protester and injuring at least 19 others.In comments that day, Trump did not specifically criticize the white nationalists and blamed “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.” Two days later, following criticism about his refusal to denounce hate groups, Trump delivered a speech at the White House. “Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,” he said.However, the same day, Kevin Plank, the head of Under Armour, and Kenneth C. Frazier, the African American head of Merck Pharmaceuticals, announced they were resigning from the president’s American Manufacturing Council in reaction to the events. Trump tweeted: “Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President’s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!” The next day, Trump reaffirmed his initial comments, telling reporters: “I think there is blame on both sides.”On September 15, Trump re-defended his comments after meeting with Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina: \"I think especially in light of the advent of antifa, if you look at what\\'s going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also. And essentially that\\'s what I said.\" (Antifa is an anti-fascist protest movement that sometimes uses violent tactics to defend against neo-Nazis and white supremacists.)2020 Presidential CampaignIn June 2019, Trump launched his 2020 reelection bid with one of his patented rallies at the 20,000-seat Amway Center in Orlando, Florida. The president whipped his supporters into a frenzy by lashing out at the special counsel “witch hunt” and his political enemies, adding that his new slogan would be “Keep America Great.”Trump’s first presidential debate against Democratic challengerJoe Bidenin September 2020 was largely criticized as a chaotic event, with the president repeatedly talking over both his opponent and debate moderator Chris Wallace. Trump defended his decision to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court so close to election day—something Republicans had blocked then-President Barack Obama from doing in 2016—and was also chided for his tepid denunciation of a far-right extremist group and his personal attacks on Biden’s son. Trump appeared more restrained at the final debate in October, where microphones were often muted to prevent interruptions.Although most national polls had Trump well behind Biden heading into election day, the president appeared to be on solid footing as he claimed the crucial state of Florida and jumped out to a lead in other battleground states. However, the race began tipping in Biden’s favor as mail-in ballots gradually added up, prompting the president to lash out about the process and launch lawsuits to challenge the results in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, and Georgia.On November 7, 2020, four days after election day, Biden was declared the winner, making Trump the first president to lose his reelection bid sinceGeorge H.W. Bushin 1992. However, Trump refused to concede in a subsequent statement, pointing to the ongoing litigation whilenotingthat “this election is far from over.” The following month, all 538 electors in the Electoral Collegecast their vote, formalizing Biden’s victory over President Trump.His lawsuits gaining little to no traction in courts around the country, the presidenturgedGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in early January 2021 to “find” the nearly 12,000 votes needed to overcome the deficit in the state to Biden. Trump alsoratcheted up the pressureon Vice PresidentMike Pence, as president of the Senate, to reject the electoral votes from contested states. A few loyal senators and dozens of House Republicans supported this effort, announcing their plans to object to the congressional certification of Biden’s electoral college win on January 6, 2021.On the day of the congressional certification, the president held a rally in which he declared that he would “never concede” and exhorted supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol building nearby. The supporterspromptly stormedthe Capitol and fought with police, at one point taking over the Senate chamber as lawmakers were evacuated for their safety.“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,” Trump tweeted, adding, “Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”Law enforcement reclaimed control of the complex later that evening, following the chaos that had resulted in four deaths, more than 50 arrests (eventually more than1,200 peoplewere arrested and charged), and the declaration of a public emergency by Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Congress soon reconvened, its session continuing well past midnight as some members continued voicing their concerns about the election results.In the early hours of January 7, the vice presidentformally declaredBiden the winner of the election. Trump issued a statement shortly afterward ensuring an “orderly transition” of power despite disagreeing with the election results. Later that day, he posteda videoon Twitter addressing the “heinous attacks” on the Capitol and also conceded the election. “We have just been through an intense election and emotions are high. But now tempers must be cooled and calm restored,” he said. “Now Congress has certified the results. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20.” In the years since, however, Trump has continued to falsely cast doubt on his election loss. Because of his posts about the Capitol riots, his social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram were suspended; his access has been restored on all three platforms.Criminal Indictments and TrialsAfter the end of his first term as president, Trump became the subject of four criminal indictments, two each at the state and federal levels. He is thefirst former U.S. president to be chargedwith either state or federal crimes. Trump pleaded not guilty in all cases, which regarded hush money payments, classified documents, and election interference.Trump set more history as the first former president to be convicted of a felony in May 2024. He awaits sentencing in that case, as two others are ongoing. Charges from Trump’s classified documents cases were dismissed by a judge. Read more about his four criminal cases:Conviction in New York Hush Money TrialOn March 30, 2023, a Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on charges he violated New York state law by obscuring payments made to his former lawyer Michael Cohen. These included the alleged “hush money” payment of $130,000 made toStormy Danielsto prevent her from revealing her alleged affair with Trump.Trump and his attorneys arranged for his surrender ahead ofan arraignmenton April 4, 2023, at which he was fingerprinted and entered his not guilty plea. He was officially charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.On May 30, 2024, a jury found Trumpguiltyon all counts. Although his sentencing was scheduled for September 18, the presidential candidate and his legal team requested the hearing be delayed until after the results of the 2024 election. As a result, Judge Juan Merchan delayed sentencing until November 26.Federal and Georgia Election Interference CasesIn an investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election thatJoe Bidenwon and Trump’s connection to the ensuing insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, special counsel Jack Smithindictedthe former president on August 1, 2023, on four federal charges, including conspiracy to defraud the United States as well as obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding.The case was delayed after Trump’s legal team filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming he had “presidential immunity” at the time of the alleged crimes. In July 2024,the court ruled, 6-3, that Trump had immunity from prosecution for official acts taken while in office. Smith filed a superseding indictment of Trump with more limited charges that August, but a potential trial date hasn’t been set. Trump called the new indictment “ridiculous” ina social media post.Election interference charges against Trump weren’t limited to the federal level. On August 14, 2023, Fulton County (Georgia) District Attorney Fani Willisindicted Trump and 18 others, accusing them of coordinating an effort to thwart certification of the state’s 2020 presidential election results after Biden won.As of September 2024,eight charges remainagainst Trump in the George case. This includes two counts of conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree, two counts of conspiracy to commit false statements and writings, and two counts of false statements and writings. A trial date hasn’t been set.Classified Documents CaseIn November 2022, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed special counsel Jack Smith to investigate allegations that Trump had mishandled classified documents. On June 9, 2023, the special counsel’s officeindicted Trumpon 37 felony counts, alleging he willfully kept documents with sensitive U.S. security information at his Mar-a-Lago Club residence in Florida and then tried to obstruct an investigation into their location. A longtime Trump aide,Walter Nauta, was also named in the document.Trump was arraigned on June 13 in Miami and pleaded not guilty. A little over a month later, in late July,prosecutors addedthree more charges against Trump and Nauta in a superseding indictment andnamedMar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira as a co-defendant.U.S. District JudgeAileen Cannonset atentative trial datefor August 14, 2023, but it was later delayed. Ultimately, Cannon—who was appointed by Trump in 2020—dismissed the casein July 2024, writing that Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded.Sexual Assault and Rape AccusationsAs of October 2024, a total of27 women have accusedTrump of sexual misconduct, including allegations of assault. Trump has denied all accusations.Trump’s behavior with women was placed under intense scrutiny in October 2016 when, two days before a presidential debate againstHillary Clinton,The Washington Postreleased a 2005 recording in which he lewdly described kissing and groping women, and trying to initiate an affair with then-married TV personality Nancy O’Dell. The three-minuterecordingcaptured Trump speaking to Billy Bush, co-anchor ofAccess Hollywood, as they prepared for a show segment with soap opera actor Arianne Zucker. “I’ve gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,” Trump said in the recording, caught on a microphone that hadn’t been turned off. “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful— I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.” He also said that because of his celebrity status, he could grab women by their genitals.In response, Trump released a statement saying: “This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago.Bill Clintonhas said far worse to me on the golf course—not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.” He also posted a videotaped apology on Facebook. “Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am,” he said.His comments on theAccess Hollywoodtape drew immediate criticism from a number of Republican congressional members, and some GOP critics called for Trump to withdraw from the race, including former Secretary of StateCondoleezza Rice. Around the same time as the video leak, numerous women began speaking publicly about their past experiences with Trump, alleging he had either sexually assaulted or harassed them based on their looks.Most recently in October 2024, former swimsuit model Stacey Williamsalleged Trump groped herinside Trump Tower in 1993 after the pair met through financier and accused sex traffickerJeffrey Epstein.E. Jean Carroll Sexual Assault AccusationsSome of the most prominent allegations against Trump have come from New York journalist E. Jean Carroll. In June 2019, Carroll accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in 1996 at the upscale Manhattan department store Bergdorf Goodman. When the alleged assault was over, Carroll called her friend, author Lisa Birnbach, to describe the encounter. Birnbach told journalists atThe New York Timesthat she told Carroll the incident was rape and that she should call the police. A couple of days later, Carroll told her friend and TV host Carol Martin, who advised her to remain silent.Carroll never publicly discussed her story until more than two decades later, when she described the alleged rape in her 2019 memoir,What Do We Need Men For?An excerpt was published in advance of the release date inaNew York Magazinearticle.Trump initially said he had “never met” Carroll. When a photograph surfaced of the two shaking hands, he said he had “no idea who she is” andcalled her accusation“fiction” designed to sell her new book.Carroll took her story to civil court, and in May 2023, a jury found Trumpliablefor sexually assaulting her and defaming her over the allegations. The following January,another jury ordered Trumpto pay more than $83 million to Carroll in compensatory and punitive damages for the defamatory remarks made during his presidency. Trump vehementlydenied the accusationsamid an appeal of the first jury ruling in September 2024.2024 Presidential CampaignUndeterred by his loss in 2020, Trump ran for president a third time, announcing his reelection bid in November 2022. “This is not just a campaign,” he told supporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. “This is a quest to save our country.” Trump’s campaign platform again focused heavily on immigration and the economy. He doubled down on his hard-line stance on the U.S.-Mexico border and promised to extend his 2017 tax cuts. He also called for further restrictions on abortion but stopped short of advocating for a national ban.Facing a crowded field of Republican challengers, including Florida GovernorRon DeSantis, former U.N. AmbassadorNikki Haley, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, and businessman Vivek Ramaswany, as well as his former vice president,Mike Pence, Trump didn’t attend the Republican presidential primary debates, opting instead to appear at town halls, rallies, or other events on the same evenings. Many of his political rivals dropped out of the race in the following weeks, with Haley hanging on even after Trump became the presumptive nominee in March 2024 despite mounting criminal indictments and his felony conviction in a hush money payments case. He officially secured the nomination during the Republican National Convention in July 2024, days after surviving an assassination attempt.Running against Democratic incumbent 81-year-oldJoe Bidenin a rare presidential rematch, 78-year-old Trump spent much of his campaign questioning Biden’s ability to serve as he made disparaging comments about his opponent’s age and mental state. Although both candidates stumbled in the first presidential debate in June 2024, Biden’s clear struggle with delivery led to his late exit from the race the following month. Vice PresidentKamala Harrismoved to the top of their reelection bid, later naming Minnesota GovernorTim Walzas her running mate as Trump tapped SenatorJD Vanceas his vice presidential candidate.Trump and Vance delivered a resounding win in the November general election, with the victory hailed as a historic political comeback. Trump, at age 78, is the oldest person to be elected president and followsGrover Clevelandas the second commander-in-chief to win nonconsecutive terms.Assassination AttemptsJust days before accepting the Republican party’s presidential nomination, Trump was the target of an apparent assassination attempt. On July 14, 2024, a gunmanfiredat the candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania. A bullet pierced Trump’s ear, as two other people were injured and one attendee was killed. The suspected shooter, identified as Thomas Matthew Cooks, was fatally shot by Secret Service agents.Trump was targeted in a second assassination attempt that September by a man with a rifle who camped outside one of the presidential candidate’s Florida golf courses for 12 hours. The suspect, Ryan Routh, was caught before anyone could be harmed. He was laterchargedwith attempted assassination of a political candidate.“Many people have told me that God spared my life for a reason,” Trump said during hisvictory speechas he was on the cusp of winning the 2024 election, “and that reason was to save our country and to restore America to greatness, and now we are going to fulfill that mission together.”Dive DeeperA History of Presidential Assassination AttemptsTrump and Obama“Birther” ControversyBeginning in early 2011, Trump expressed doubts about the validity of Obama’s birth country to media outlets. To quell the staunch outcry from birtherists, Obama eventually released his birth certificate in April 2011, verifying that he was born in the United States. Regardless, Trump continued to be a vocal critic of President Obama—not only regarding his place of birth, but also on a variety of his policies.In 2013, Trump tweeted that a Hawaiian State Health Director, who died of cardiac arrhythmia following a plane crash, was somehow connected to a cover-up of President Obama\\'s birth certificate. In 2016, as he began to clinch his own nomination as the GOP candidate for president, Trump toned down his stance, telling CNN, “I have my own theory on Obama. Someday I will write a book.”Later that fall, feeling pressure from his campaign advisors to put the conspiracy theory to rest as part of a strategy to appeal to minority voters, Trump issued a statement: \"President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.” At the same time, he also blamed his presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and her campaign for starting the birther controversy.Wiretapping AllegationsOn March 4, 2017, without citing specific evidence, Trump released a series of tweets accusing former President Obama of wiretapping the campaign headquarters at Trump Tower before the election.FBI DirectorJames Comeyasked the Justice Department to issue a statement refuting Trump’s allegation, while the White House called for a congressional investigation into Trump’s claims.On March 16, 2017, bipartisan leaders from the Senate Intelligence Committee said there was no evidence to support the president’s claim that Trump Tower had been wiretapped. On March 20, 2017, Comey addressed the wiretapping allegations, saying that he had “no information that supports those tweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI.”Comey also confirmed that the FBI was investigating the Russian government\\'s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including links and coordination between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government as well as whether any crimes were committed.Comey and TrumpOn May 9, 2017, Trump abruptly fired Comey, who was in the midst of leading the investigation into whether any Trump advisers colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the presidential election.The president said he based his decision on recommendations from Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who asserted that Comey should be dismissed over his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton\\'s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.The announcement sent shockwaves throughout the government, with critics comparing Comey\\'s dismissal to the 1973 \"Saturday Night Massacre\" when President Richard Nixon fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor investigating theWatergate scandalwhich eventually led to Nixon\\'s resignation.Democratic Senate Minority LeaderCharles Schumertold reporters at a press conference that “every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up.”Trump later told reporters at the White House that he had fired Comey “because he wasn’t doing a good job,” and he told Lester Holt in an NBC News interview that his decision was not solely based on recommendations from Sessions and Rosenstein. \"Regardless of the recommendation, I was going to fire Comey,\" the president told Holt in the televised interview.There was more fallout a week after Comey\\'s firing when theNew York Timesreported that Trump had asked Comey to shut down the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.According to theNew York Times,Comey wrote in a memo that the president told him in a meeting a day after Flynn resigned: \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\" The White House denied this claim in a statement.On June 8, Comey made a highly anticipated appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He accused Trump of lying to the public about the nature of his tenure and dismissal, noting that he believed he was fired to affect the FBI probe into Russia\\'s influence in the 2016 election.Getty ImagesBarron Trump joins his father U.S. President Donald Trump as he makes remarks before pardoning the National Thanksgiving Turkey with National Turkey Federation Chairman Carl Wittenburg and his family in the Rose Garden at the White House November 21, 2017, in Washington, D.C.Mueller Investigation of Donald TrumpOn May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein selectedRobert Mueller, former federal prosecutor and FBI director, to serve as a special counsel to lead the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible ties to the Trump campaign.On March 24, 2019, two days after Mueller closed his investigation by submitting a report to Attorney General Barr, the AG summarized the report\\'s content in a letter to congressional leaders. He wrote that there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian agents, but noted the special counsel\\'s wording about whether the president obstructed justice: \"while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\" Nonetheless, Trump declared complete exoneration, disparaging the 22-month investigation as an \"illegal takedown that failed.\"On October 30, 2018, Mueller announced the first indictments of his investigation, ensnaring former Trump campaign chairmanPaul Manafortand his associate Rick Gates on charges of tax fraud, money laundering and foreign lobbying violations. On December 1, Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI and said he was cooperating with Mueller\\'s team.In January 2018, news surfaced that Mueller was seeking an interview with Trump to inquire about his dismissal of Comey and Flynn, among other topics. The president publicly welcomed that idea, saying he was \"looking forward to it.\" Days later theNew York Timesreported that Trump had sought to fire Mueller the previous June, before backing off when the White House counsel protested.In early February, the president gave the go-ahead for House Republicans to release a controversial memo that summarized the FBI\\'s attempts to obtain a warrant to wiretap former Trump campaign associate Carter Page. According to the memo, the FBI and DOJ had relied on information from an infamous dossier, whose author was commissioned by the Democratic Party to dig up dirt on Trump. House Democrats countered that the memo left out important information to make it seem that the FBI was biased against Trump, thereby discrediting the bureau\\'s involvement in the Mueller probe.In April,The Timesobtained and published a list of four dozen questions that Mueller hoped to ask Trump, ranging from the president\\'s contacts with Manafort to his understanding of the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower conducted by his oldest son, to the intentions behind some of his tweets as related to possible obstruction of justice. Ultimately, the president never sat down for face-to-face questioning by Mueller, instead of submitting written responses.Mueller’s report was released in March 2019, finding no evidence of collusion but offering obtuse language on whether the president obstructed justice. The furor over the report didn\\'t die down, particularly since the redacted version that was released raised more questions about obstruction and whether Barr was attempting to shield the president from congressional scrutiny.In May 2019, after Trump exerted executive privilege to block the release of the unredacted report. The House Judiciary Committee voted to recommend that the House hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress.Trump and Stormy DanielsAdult-film star Stephanie Clifford, known by her stage name ofStormy Daniels, reportedly signed a nondisclosure agreement just before the 2016 election to remain silent on her affair with Trump.After theWall Street Journalreported on the situation in early 2018, the Daniels saga became part of the news cycle, leading to a much-publicized appearance on Jimmy Kimmel\\'s late-night show in which she played coy on the issue.In February 2018, Trump\\'s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, admitted to paying Daniels $130,000 out of his own pocket, though he did not say what the payment was for. In March, Daniels broke her silence on the subject, insisting that the nondisclosure agreement was invalid because Trump had never signed it.Late March brought a60 Minutesinterview with Daniels, in which she described her alleged tryst with Trump, as well as a parking lot encounter with an unknown man who warned her to stop discussing the affair in public. The piece aired shortly after a televised interview with another alleged Trump mistress, formerPlayboymodel Karen McDougal, who said she had fallen in love with Trump during their time together.The president delivered his first public remarks on the issue aboard Air Force One in early April, saying he knew nothing about the payment to Daniels. When asked why Cohen felt compelled to shell out $130,000 for what the White House was calling false allegations, Trump responded, \"Michael\\'s my attorney, and you\\'ll have to ask Michael.\"Later in the month, McDougal reached a settlement with American Media Inc (AMI) that allowed her to speak freely about her alleged affair with Trump. The model had signed $150,000 deal in 2016 that gave AMI\\'sThe National Enquirerexclusive story rights, though the tabloid never reported on the matter. Under terms of the new contract, McDougal was allowed to keep the $150,000, though she would have to share the profits if she sold or licensed the story to a new party.Shortly afterward, Daniels filed a defamation lawsuit against the president, after he dismissed a composite sketch of a man who allegedly confronted her in a parking lot as a \"con job.\" The suit claimed that Trump had recklessly accused her of being a liar and breaking the law, resulting in more than $75,000 in damages.Michael Cohen InvestigationIn July 2018, Trump’s former personal lawyerMichael Cohenfound himself under investigation by the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the Southern District of New York. He released a two-year-old secret recording of a conversation with Trump about payments to AMI for the McDougal story, indicating that the president was aware of the situation dating back to his days as a candidate.The issue magnified in August, when Cohen accepted a deal to plead guilty to eight criminal charges, two of which, he said, came at the president\\'s instigation to violate campaign laws and issue hush payments. Trump\\'s former personal lawyer was sentenced to three years in prison that December.The following February, Cohen appeared before the House Oversight Committee in a televised hearing to testify to an array of Trump\\'s infractions. Along with insisting that his ex-boss knew ahead of time about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians and the WikiLeaks dump of DNC emails, both of which came in mid-2016, he supplied checks as evidence of the president\\'s reimbursement of his payment to Stormy Daniels.Inaugural CommitteeIn February 2019, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York issued a subpoena to Trump’s inaugural committee, seeking a collection of documents that included bank accounts of committee members and names of donors, vendors and contractors.The committee grew out of investigations into Michael Cohen. It was believed that prosecutors were investigating crimes related to conspiracy to defraud the United States, false statements and money laundering.Pressuring Ukraine and Whistleblower ComplaintIn September 2019,The Washington Postreported that Trump had ordered the withholding of nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in mid-July, one week before a phone call in which he urged Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of 2020 presidential candidateJoe Biden. This tied into reports of a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community regarding communications between Trump and Ukraine, and the failure of the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, to relay the complaint to Congress.Trump admitted to discussing Joe and Hunter Biden with Zelensky, and even released a transcript of their conversation, though he denied that he withheld the military aid as a means for pressuring his counterpart into digging up dirt on a political rival. He later doubled down on his assertion that the Bidens needed to be investigated, calling for the Chinese government to do so.In October, as House Democrats attempted to secure testimony from the unidentified whistleblower, reports surfaced of another individual with first-hand knowledge of several allegations noted in the complaint. William B. Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, soon defied State Department orders to share his recollection of events with investigators and corroborate the claims of quid pro quo. He was followed by Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, who reportedly confirmed that he was on the phone call between Trump and Zelensky and was concerned that the demand to investigate the Bidens would jeopardize U.S.-Ukraine relations.Impeachment and AcquittalBy the time Mueller’s special counsel investigation into Trump ended in March 2019, some Democrats were calling for the initiation of impeachment proceedings, including 2020 Democratic presidential hopefulsKamala HarrisandCory Booker.Calls for impeachment grew after Mueller held a press conference regarding his report in May 2019. Mueller said he could not clear the President of obstruction of justice but declined to pursue impeachment, leaving Democrats to decide if Trump’s conduct should be investigated for impeachable offenses. However, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler and House SpeakerNancy Pelosiwere not in favor of pursuing impeachment.In July 2019, after the House voted to condemn Trump for his Twitter comments about four congresswomen of color, Democrat Al Green of Texas filed a resolution to launch impeachment proceedings against the president. With most of his Democratic colleagues not yet ready to make the plunge, the resolution was defeated by a 332-to-95 vote.The tide turned with the reports of Trump pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden and the administration\\'s attempt to conceal the whistleblower complaint. On September 24, 2019, Pelosi announced that the House was launching a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump.On October 31, following five weeks of investigations and interviews, the House voted 232-196 to approve a resolution that established rules for the impeachment process. All but two Democrats and the House\\'s lone independent voted for the measure, while Republicans were unanimous in their opposition.Impeachment hearings commenced on November 13 with testimony from Taylor and another State Department official, as Trump was busy meeting with PresidentRecep Tayyip Erdoganof Turkey. The following week, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, provided more testimony about what he said was a clear case of quid pro quo, noting that Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Pompeo and other top administration officials were aware of Trump\\'s pressure campaign.On December 10, 2019, House Democrats announced they were moving forward with two articles of impeachment, charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Eight days later, the House again voted almost entirely along party lines for the two articles, making Trump the third U.S. president to be impeached by the House, after Andrew Johnson, in 1868, and Bill Clinton, in 1998;President Richard Nixon resignedbefore he could be impeached.The Senate trial formally began on January 21, 2020, with seven House Democrat impeachment managers arguing their case of Trump\\'s abuses against the president\\'s legal defense that everything was valid. Although former national security adviser John Bolton lurked as a potential wild card, following reports that his upcoming book revealed more evidence of Trump tying Ukraine aid to political investigations, his account became irrelevant when the Senate voted against allowing additional witnesses on January 31.The impeachment saga came to an end on February 5, 2020, when the Senate voted along party lines to acquit President Trump on both charges. Mitt Romney, now senator of Utah, was the lone Republican to vote to convict on the charge of abuse of power.CoronavirusAfter taking a victory lap for beating back the impeachment attempt, Trump faced a new challenge with the emergence of the novel coronavirus from China. The White House initially requested $2.5 billion in emergency funding to deal with the outbreak, a reflection of the president\\'s belief that the threat wasn\\'t particularly dire, though lawmakers on both sides of the aisle suggested that number was too low.On February 26, 2020, the same day that the 60th known coronavirus patient was recorded in the U.S., Trump announced that Vice President Pence would lead the administration\\'s response to the health crisis. \"We\\'re very, very ready for this,\" the president said. \"The risk to the American people remains very low.\"Despite his reassurances, the situation continued to escalate in the coming weeks as the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic and major American sports leagues suspended their seasons. On March 13, one day after stocks suffered the biggest daily drop since Black Monday of 1987, the president announced that he was declaring a national emergency to free up $50 billion in federal resources to combat the health crisis.On March 18, Trump pushed out the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which provided paid sick leave for some workers, funding for food assistance programs, expanded unemployment benefits and free diagnostic testing. He followed by signing a $2 trillion relief bill on March 27, which established a $500 billion government lending program and allocated funds for both hospitals and individual taxpayers.Facing criticism for his handling of the situation, on April 14, the president announced that he was suspending funding to the WHO for \"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.\" The following week, he signed an executive order that halted the issuance of green cards for 60 days — with exemptions for medical workers and family members of U.S. citizens — in order to protect American workers during the pandemic.Trump at times clashed withDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), who sought to reel in the president\\'s ambitions for reopening the country as quickly as possible. In May, after Fauci told the Senate that some schools wouldn\\'t be ready to safely welcome back students in the fall, Trump decried that analysis as \"not an acceptable answer.\"On October 2, 2020, President Trump revealed that he and wife Melania had both tested positive for COVID-19. Later that day he was transferred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, after feeling “fatigued,\"accordingto his physician. He left the hospital on October 5. Son Barron was also tested and initially tested negative, but it was revealed weeks later that a second test came back positive.Social Media Executive OrderKnown for his frequent use of Twitter to promote his agenda and attack critics, Trump came under fire in May 2020 for retweeting claims that former congressman turned MSNBC host Joe Scarborough had killed one of the staffers. Around that time, the president delivered a series of tweets alleging that mail-in voting would lead to widespread fraud, prompting Twitter to add fact-checking links to two of his posts.After accusing the social media platform of trying to censor him and \"interfering\" in the 2020 election, Trump signed an executive order that called for new regulations under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) to remove statutory liability protections and cut federal funding for Twitter, Facebook and other tech companies that engage in censorship and political conduct.QuotesGoing through tough times is a wonderful thing, and everybody should try it. Once.I DON’T do it for the money. I’ve got enough, much more than I’ll ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form.I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans.As I’ve said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families.[2016 presidential victory speech]I will govern by a simple motto: Promises made, promises kept.

Two years later, he transferred to theWharton Schoolof theUniversity of Pennsylvania,[7]graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.[8]In 2015, he threatened his high school, colleges, and theCollege Boardwith legal action if they released his academic records.[9]In 1977, Trump married Czech modelIvana ZelnÃ\\xadÄ�kovÃ¡.[10]They had three children:Donald Jr.(born 1977),Ivanka(1981), andEric(1984). The couple divorced in 1990, following his affair with actressMarla Maples.[11]He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter,Tiffany(born 1993), who Maples raised in California.[12]In 2005, he married Slovenian modelMelania Knauss.[13]They have one son,Barron(born 2006).[14]Personal lifeHealth habitsTrump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs.[15][16]He sleeps about four or five hours a night.[17][18]He has called golfing his \"primary form of exercise\", but usually does not walk the course.[19]He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is \"like a battery, with a finite amount of energy\", which is depleted by exercise.[20][21]In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician,Harold Bornstein, stating that he would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\".[22]In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump\\'s agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor\\'s office.[22][23]WealthMain article:Wealth of Donald TrumpTrump (rightmost) and wife Ivana in the receiving line of a state dinner for KingFahd of Saudi Arabiain 1985, with U.S. presidentRonald Reaganand First LadyNancy ReaganIn 1982, Trump made the initialForbeslist of wealthy people for holding a share of his family\\'s estimated $200\\xa0million net worth (equivalent to $631\\xa0million in 2023).[24]His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.[25]After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with theFECin July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10\\xa0billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4\\xa0billion in assets and $265\\xa0million in liabilities.[26]Forbesestimated his net worth dropped by $1.4\\xa0billion between 2015 and 2018.[27]In their 2024 billionaires ranking, his net worth was estimated to be $2.3\\xa0billion (1,438th in the world).[28]In 2018, journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported that Trump had called him in 1984 pretending to be a fictional Trump Organization official named \"John Barron\". Greenberg said that, to get a higher ranking on theForbes400list of wealthy Americans, Trump, speaking as \"Barron\", falsely asserted that Donald Trump owned more than 90\\xa0percent of his father\\'s business. Greenberg also wrote thatForbeshad vastly overestimated Trump\\'s wealth and wrongly included him on the 1982, 1983, and 1984 rankings.[29]Trump has often said he began his career with \"a small loan of a million dollars\" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[30]He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60\\xa0million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413\\xa0million (2018 dollars adjusted for inflation) from his father\\'s company.[31][32]In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and theNew York State Department of Taxation and Financestarted an investigation.[32]His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets.[33][34]Forbesestimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5\\xa0billion in 2015 to $3.1\\xa0billion in 2017 and his product-licensing income from $23\\xa0million to $3\\xa0million.[35]Trump\\'s tax returnsfrom 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17\\xa0billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250\\xa0million each year, were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7\\xa0million (equivalent to $1.83\\xa0billion in 2023).[36][37][24]In 2020,The New York Timesobtained Trump\\'s tax information extending over two decades.

Roberts Jr.atthe Capitol, January\\xa020, 2017.Trump was inauguratedon January\\xa020, 2017. During his first week in office, he signedsix executive orders, authorizing interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of theMexico City policy, advancement of theKeystone XLandDakota Access Pipelineconstruction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[234]Trump\\'s daughter Ivanka and son-in-lawJared Kushnerbecame hisassistantandsenior advisor, respectively.[235][236]Conflicts of interestSee also:First presidency of Donald Trump Â§\\xa0EthicsBefore being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into arevocable trust,[237][238]rather than ablind trustor equivalent arrangement \"to cleanly sever himself from his business interests\".[239]He continued to profit from his businesses and to know how his administration\\'s policies affected his businesses.[238][240]Although he said he would eschew \"new foreign deals\", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Scotland, Dubai, and the Dominican Republic.[238][240]Trump was sued for violating theDomesticandForeign Emoluments Clausesof theU.S. Constitution, marking the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated.[241]One case was dismissed in lower court.[242]Two were dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court as moot after the end of his term.[243]Domestic policyEconomyMain article:Economic policy of the first Donald Trump administrationTrump took office at the height of the longesteconomic expansionin American history,[244]which began in 2009 and continued until February 2020, when theCOVID-19 recessionbegan.[245]In December 2017, Trump signed theTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017passed by Congress without Democratic votes.[relevant?]It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals, with business tax cuts to be permanent and individual tax cuts set to expire after 2025,[importance?]and set the penalty associated with theAffordable Care Act\\'s individual mandate to $0.[246][247]The Trump administration claimed that the act would not decrease government revenue, but 2018 revenues were 7.6\\xa0percent lower than projected.[248]Under Trump, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50\\xa0percent, to nearly $1\\xa0trillion in 2019.[249]By the end of his term, theU.S. national debtincreased by 39\\xa0percent, reaching $27.75\\xa0trillion, and the U.S.debt-to-GDP ratiohit a post-World War II high.[250]Trump also failed to deliver the $1\\xa0trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.[251]Trump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3\\xa0million people.[244][252]Climate change, environment, and energyMain article:Environmental policy of the first Donald Trump administrationTrump rejects thescientific consensus on climate change.[253][254][255][256]He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40\\xa0percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.[257]Hewithdrew from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation to not ratify it.[258]Trump aimed to boost the production and exports offossil fuels.[259][260]Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.[261][262]He rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbedgreenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowingdrilling in the Arctic Refuge.[263]DeregulationIn 2017, Trump signedExecutive Order 13771, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies \"identify\" two existing regulations for elimination, although it did not require elimination.[264]He dismantled many federal regulations on health,[265][266]labor,[267][266]and the environment,[268][266]among others, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.[269]During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,[270]often \"after requests by the regulated industries\".[271]TheInstitute for Policy Integrityfound that 78\\xa0percent of his proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.[272]Health careDuring his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace theAffordable Care Act.[273]In office, he scaled back the Act\\'s implementation through executive orders.[274][275]He expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\"; his administration halved theenrollment periodand drastically reduced funding for enrollment promotion.[276][277]In June 2018, the Trump administrationjoined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Courtthat the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the Act unconstitutional.[278][279]Their pleading would have eliminatedhealth insurance coveragefor up to 23\\xa0million Americans, but was unsuccessful.[278]During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs. In January 2020, he expressed willingness to consider cuts to them.[280]In response to theopioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a record 50,052 in 2019.[281]Social issuesMain article:Social policy of Donald TrumpTrump barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.[282]He said he supported \"traditional marriage\", but considered thenationwide legalityofsame-sex marriage\"settled\".[283]His administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration\\'s workplace protections againstdiscrimination of LGBTQ people.[284]His attempted rollback of anti-discrimination protections fortransgenderpatients in August 2020 was halted by a federal judge after a Supreme Court ruling extended employees\\' civil rights protections togender identityand sexual orientation.[285]Trump has said he isopposedtogun control, although his views have shifted over time.[286]After severalmass shootingsduring his term, he said he would propose legislation related to guns, but he abandoned that effort in November 2019.[287]His administration took ananti-marijuana position, revokingObama-era policiesthat provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.[288]Trump is a long-time advocate of capital punishment.[289][290]Under his administration, thefederal government executed13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined, ending a 17-year moratorium.[291]In 2016, he said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such aswaterboarding.[292][293]Trump and group of officials and advisors on the way from the White House to St. John\\'s ChurchIn June 2020, during theGeorge Floyd protests, federal law-enforcement officials controversially usedless lethalweapons to remove a largely peaceful crowd of lawful protesters fromLafayette Square, outside theWhite House.[294][295]Trump then posed with a Bible fora photo-opat the nearbySt. John\\'s Episcopal Church,[294][296][297]with religious leaders condemning both the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.[298]Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned his proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.[299]Pardons and commutationsFurther information:List of people granted executive clemency by Donald TrumpTrump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception ofGeorge H. W. BushandGeorge W. Bush.[300]Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department\\'sOffice of the Pardon Attorney; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.[301][302]In his last full day in office, he granted 73 pardons and commuted 70 sentences.[303]Several Trump allies were not eligible for pardons under Justice Department rules, and in other cases the department had opposed clemency.[301]The pardons of three military service members convicted of or charged with violent crimes were opposed by military leaders.[304]ImmigrationMain article:Immigration policy of Donald TrumpTrump\\'s proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter debate during the 2016 campaign. He promised to builda wallon theMexicoâ€“U.S. borderto restrict illegal movement and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[305]He pledged to deport millions ofillegal immigrants residing in the U.S.,[306]and criticizedbirthright citizenshipfor incentivizing \"anchor babies\".[307]As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \"invasion\" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gangMS-13.[308]Trump drastically escalated immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.[309][310]From 2018 onward, Trumpdeployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.â€“Mexico border[311]to stop most Central American migrants from seeking asylum. In 2020, his administration widened thepublic charge ruleto further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency.[312]He reduced the number ofrefugees admittedto record lows. When he took office, the annual limit was 110,000; he set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year.[313][314]Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted than the allowed limits.[315]Travel banMain article:Trump travel banFurther information:Executive Order 13769andExecutive Order 13780Following the2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump proposed to banMuslimforeigners from entering the U.S. until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[316]He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[317]On January\\xa027, 2017, Trump signedExecutive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning, causing chaos at airports.[318][319]Protests began at airportsthe next day,[318][319]andlegal challengesresulted innationwide preliminary injunctions.[320]A March\\xa06revised order, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, again was blocked by federal judges in three states.[321][322]In adecision in June 2017, theSupreme Courtruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of abona fiderelationship with a person or entity in the United States\".[323]The temporary order was replaced byPresidential Proclamation 9645on September\\xa024, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.[324]After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December\\xa04, 2017,[325]and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a ruling in June 2019.[326]Family separation at the borderMain article:Trump administration family separation policyChildren sitting within a wire mesh compartment in theUrsula detention facilityinMcAllen, Texas, June 2018The Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.â€“Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[327][328]In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy whereby adults suspected ofillegal entrywere to be detained and criminally prosecuted while their children were taken away as unaccompanied alien minors.[329][330]The policy was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage.[331][332]Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration\\'s policy.[333][334][335]Although Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he acceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order in June 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless \"there is a concern\" of a risk to the child.[336][337]On June\\xa026, 2018, JudgeDana Sabrawconcluded that the Trump administration had \"no system in place to keep track of\" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification;[338]Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances.[339]After the order, the Trump administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; theACLUcontended that the Trump administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.[328]Trump wall and government shutdownMain articles:Trump walland2018â€“2019 United States federal government shutdownTrump examines border wall prototypes inOtay Mesa, California.One of Trump\\'s central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600\\xa0km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.[340]By the end of his term, the U.S. had built \"40 miles [64\\xa0km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53\\xa0km] of secondary wall\" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587\\xa0km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.[341]In 2018, Trump refused to sign anyappropriations billfrom Congress unless it allocated $5.6\\xa0billion for the border wall,[342]resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, thelongest U.S. government shutdown in history.[343][344]Around 800,000 government employees werefurloughedor worked without pay.[345]Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers, but no funds for the wall.[343]The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3\\xa0billion to the economy, according to theCongressional Budget Office.[346]About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and Trump\\'s approval ratings dropped.[347]To prevent another imminent shutdown in February 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a funding bill that included $1.375\\xa0billion for 55 miles (89\\xa0km) of bollard border fencing.[348]Trump also declared anational emergency on the southern border, intending to divert $6.1\\xa0billion of funds Congress had allocated to other purposes.[348]Trumpvetoedajoint resolutionto overturn the declaration, and the Senate voted against aveto override.[349]Legal challenges to the diversion of $2.5\\xa0billion originally meant for theDepartment of Defense\\'s drug interdiction efforts[350][351]and $3.6\\xa0billion originally meant for military construction[352][353]were unsuccessful.Foreign policyMain article:Foreign policy of the first Donald Trump administrationSee also:List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump Â§\\xa0First presidency (2017â€“2021)Trump with the otherG7leaders at the45th summitin France, 2019Trump described himself as a \"nationalist\"[354]and his foreign policy as \"America First\".[355]He praised and supportedpopulist,neo-nationalist, and authoritarian governments.[356]Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump\\'s tenure included unpredictability, uncertainty, and inconsistency.[355][357]Tensions between the U.S. and its European allies were strained under Trump.[358]He criticizedNATO alliesand privately suggested on multiple occasions that the U.S. shouldwithdraw from NATO.[359][360]TradeSee also:Trump tariffsTrump withdrew the U.S. from theTrans-Pacific Partnership(TPP) negotiations,[361]imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[362]and launched atrade war with Chinaby sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50\\xa0billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[363]While Trump said that import tariffs are paid by China into theU.S. Treasury, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.[364]Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.\\'s largetrade deficits, the trade deficit skyrocketed under Trump.[365]Following a 2017â€“2018 renegotiation, theUnited Statesâ€“Mexicoâ€“Canada Agreement(USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.[366]RussiaSee also:Russiaâ€“United States relations Â§\\xa0First Trump administration (2017â€“2021)Vladimir Putinand Trump shaking hands at theG20 Osaka summit, June 2019The Trump administration weakened the toughest sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Russian entities after Russia\\'s2014 annexation of Crimea.[367][368]Trump withdrew the U.S. from theIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian noncompliance,[369]and supported a potential return of Russia to theG7.[370]Trump repeatedly praised and rarely criticized Russian presidentVladimir Putin[371][372]but opposed some actions of the Russian government.[373][374]After he met Putin at theHelsinki Summitin 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for accepting Putin\\'s denial ofRussian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies.[375][376][377]Trump did not discuss allegedRussian bountiesoffered toTalibanfighters for attacking American soldiers in Afghanistan with Putin, saying both that he doubted the intelligence and that he was not briefed on it.[378]East AsiaChina, Hong Kong, TaiwanSee also:Chinaâ€“United States relations Â§\\xa0First Trump administration (2017â€“2021)Trump and Chinese leaderXi Jinpingat theG20 Buenos Aires summit, December 2018Trump repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S.[379]Helaunched a trade war against Chinathat was widely characterized as a failure,[380][381]sanctionedHuaweifor alleged ties to Iran,[382]significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars,[383]and classified China as acurrency manipulator.[384]Trump also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise ofChinese Communist PartyleaderXi Jinping,[385]which was attributed to trade war negotiations.[386]After initially praising China forits handling of COVID-19,[387]he began a campaign of criticism starting in March 2020.[388]Trump said he resisted punishing China forits human rights abusesagainst ethnic minorities in theXinjiangregion for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations.[389]In July 2020,the Trump administration imposed sanctionsand visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, in response to expanded massdetention campsholding more than a million of the country\\'sUyghurminority.[390]North KoreaSee also:North Koreaâ€“United States relations Â§\\xa0First Trump administration (2017â€“2021),2017â€“2018 North Korea crisis, and2018â€“19 Korean peace processTrump and North Korean leaderKim Jong Unat theSingapore summit, June 2018In 2017, whenNorth Korea\\'s nuclear weaponswere increasingly seen as a serious threat,[391]Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\".[392][393]In 2017, Trump declared that he wanted North Korea\\'s \"complete denuclearization\", and engaged inname-callingwith leaderKim Jong Un.[392][394]After this period of tension, Trump and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship.[395][396]In March 2019, Trump lifted some U.S.sanctions against North Koreaagainst the advice of his Treasury Department.[397]Trump, the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader, met Kim three times:in Singaporein 2018,in Hanoiin 2019, andin the Korean Demilitarized Zonein 2019.[398]However, nodenuclearizationagreement was reached,[399]and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.[400]While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles.[401][402]Middle EastAfghanistanU.S. Secretary of StateMike Pompeomeeting with Taliban delegation inQatarin September 2020U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,[403]reversing Trump\\'s preelection position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[404]In February 2020, the Trump administration signed apeace agreement with the Taliban, which called for thewithdrawal of foreign troopsin 14 months \"contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies\" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000Talibanimprisoned by the Afghan government.[405][406][407]By the end of Trump\\'s term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integratingAl-Qaedamembers into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.[407]IsraelTrump supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu.[408]Under Trump, the U.S.recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel[409]andIsraeli sovereigntyover theGolan Heights,[410]leading to international condemnation including from theUN General Assembly,European Union, andArab League.[411][412]In 2020, the White House hosted the signing of agreements, namedAbraham Accords, between Israel and theUnited Arab EmiratesandBahrainto normalize their foreign relations.[413]Saudi ArabiaTrump, KingSalman of Saudi Arabia, and Egyptian presidentAbdel Fattah el-Sisiat the2017 Riyadh summitin Saudi ArabiaTrump actively supported theSaudi Arabianâ€“led intervention in Yemenagainst theHouthisand in 2017 signed a $110\\xa0billion agreement to sell arms toSaudi Arabia.[414]In 2018, the U.S. provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention.[415][416]Following the2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed onIran, Trump approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, twoPatriot batteries, and aTerminal High Altitude Area Defensesystem, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.[417]SyriaTrump and Turkish presidentRecep Tayyip ErdoÄŸanat the White House in May 2017Trump orderedmissile strikes in April 2017andApril 2018against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for theKhan ShaykhunandDouma chemical attacks, respectively.[418][419]In December 2018, Trump declared \"we have won against ISIS\", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria.[420][421]The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling Trump\\'s decision an abandonment of the U.S.\\'sKurdish allieswho played a

attacking anddisplacingAmerican-alliedKurds.[423]The U.S. House of Representatives voted 354â€“60 to condemn Trump\\'s withdrawal of those U.S. troops from Syria.[424][425]IranIn May 2018, Trumpwithdrew the U.S.from theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 agreement that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for restrictions onIran\\'s nuclear program.[426][427]In August 2020, the Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to use a section of the nuclear deal to have the UN reimpose sanctions against Iran.[428]Analysts determined that, after the U.S. withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.[429][430]On January\\xa01, 2020, Trump ordereda U.S. airstrikethat killed Iranian generalQasem Soleimani, who had planned nearly every significant Iranian andIranian-backedoperation over the preceding two decades.[431][432]One week later, Iran retaliated withballistic missile strikes against two U.S. airbasesin Iraq. Dozens of soldiers sustained traumatic brain injuries. Trump downplayed their injuries, and they were initially deniedPurple Heartmedals and the benefits accorded to their recipients.[433][429]PersonnelMain articles:Political appointments by Donald TrumpandFirst cabinet of Donald TrumpThe Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump\\'s first year in office, 34\\xa0percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[434]As of early July\\xa02018[update], 61\\xa0percent of Trump\\'s senior aides had left[435]and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[436]Both figures set a record for recent presidentsâ€”more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[437]Notable early departures included National Security AdvisorMichael Flynn(after just 25 days), and Press SecretarySean Spicer.[437]Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon,Hope Hicks,John McEntee, andKeith Schillerquit or were forced out.[438]Some later returned in different posts.[439]Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[440]Trump had fourWhite House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several.[441]Reince Priebuswas replaced after seven months by retired Marine generalJohn F. Kelly.[442]Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and Trump subsequently disparaged him.[443]Kelly was succeeded byMick Mulvaneyas acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 byMark Meadows.[441]On May\\xa09, 2017, Trumpdismissed FBI director James Comey. While initially attributing this action to Comey\\'s conduct in the investigation aboutHillary Clinton\\'s emails, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey\\'s role in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[444]At a private conversation in February, Trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn.[445]In March and April, Trump asked Comey to \"lift the cloud impairing his ability to act\" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.[445][446]Trump lost three of his 15 original cabinet members within his first year.[447]Health and Human Services secretaryTom Pricewas forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft.[447][438]Environmental Protection Agency administratorScott Pruittresigned in 2018 and Secretary of the InteriorRyan Zinkein January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.[448][449]Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[450]By January\\xa08, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61\\xa0percent) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37\\xa0percent).[451]JudiciaryFurther information:List of federal judges appointed by Donald TrumpandDonald Trump judicial appointment controversiesTrump and his third Supreme Court nominee,Amy Coney BarrettTrump appointed 226Article III judges, including 54 to thecourts of appealsandthreeto theSupreme Court:Neil Gorsuch,Brett Kavanaugh, andAmy Coney Barrett.[452]His Supreme Court nominees were noted as having politically shifted the Court to the right.[453][454][455]In the 2016 campaign, he pledged thatRoe v. Wadewould be overturned \"automatically\" if he were elected and provided the opportunity to appoint two or three anti-abortion justices. He later took credit whenRoewas overturned inDobbs v. Jackson Women\\'s Health Organization; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.[456][457][458]Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary\\'s constitutional authority. His attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of his statements on thejudicial independenceand public confidence in the judiciary.[459][460][461]COVID-19 pandemicMain article:COVID-19 pandemic in the United StatesFurther information:U.S. federal government response to the COVID-19 pandemicandCommunication of the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemicSee also:Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United StatesInitial responseThe first confirmed case ofCOVID-19in the U.S. was reported on January\\xa020, 2020.[462]The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency byHealth and Human Services (HHS) SecretaryAlex Azaron January\\xa031, 2020.[463]Trump initially ignored persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.[464][465]Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak.[466]In February 2020 Trump publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly thaninfluenza, was \"very much under control\", and would soon be over.[467]On March\\xa019, 2020, Trump privately toldBob Woodwardthat he was deliberately \"playing it down, because I don\\'t want to create a panic\".[468][469]By mid-March, most global financial markets hadseverely contractedin response to the pandemic.[470]On March\\xa06, Trump signed theCoronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3\\xa0billion in emergency funding for federal agencies.[471]On March\\xa011, theWorld Health Organization(WHO) recognized COVID-19 as apandemic,[472]and Trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March\\xa013.[473]That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak \"horrible\" but \"a temporary moment\" and saying there was no financial crisis.[474]On March\\xa013, he declared anational emergency, freeing up federal resources.[475]Trump claimed that \"anybody that wants a test can get a test\", despite test availability being severely limited.[476]On April\\xa022, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration.[477]In late spring and early summer, with infections and deaths continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.[478]White House Coronavirus Task ForceTrump conducts a COVID-19 press briefing with members of theWhite House Coronavirus Task Forceon March 15, 2020.Trump established theWhite House Coronavirus Task Forceon January\\xa029, 2020.[479]Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,[480]sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.[481]Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.[480][482]On March\\xa016, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.[483]His repeated use of \"Chinese virus\" and \"China virus\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.[484][485][486]By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration\\'s response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the WHO.[487]The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;[488]the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.[489][490]In early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump said the task force would \"indefinitely\" continue.[491]By the end of May, the coronavirus task force\\'s meetings were sharply reduced.[492]World Health OrganizationPrior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the WHO and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[493]His administration\\'s proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[493]In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of \"severely mismanaging\" COVID-19, alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government\\'s concealment of the pandemic\\'s origins,[493][494][495]and announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[493]These were seen as attempts to distract from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[493][496][497]In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the U.S. from the WHO, effective July 2021.[494][495]The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \"short-sighted\", \"senseless\", and \"dangerous\".[494][495]Pressure to abandon pandemic mitigation measuresFurther information:COVID-19 testing in the United StatesIn April 2020, Republican-connected groups organizedanti-lockdown protestsagainst the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;[498][499]Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter,[500]although the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration\\'s guidelines for reopening.[501]In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized,GeorgiaGovernorBrian Kemp\\'s plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.[502]Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions to reverse the damage to the country\\'s economy.[503]Trump often refused tomaskat public events, contrary to his administration\\'s April 2020 guidance to wear masks in public[504]and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing spread of the virus.[505]By June, Trump had said masks were a \"double-edged sword\"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.[505]Trump\\'s contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.[504][505]In June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \"makes us look bad\".[506][507]The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be \"quickly identified and tested\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.[508][509]In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.[510][511]The day after thispolitical interferencewas reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation.[511]Despite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99\\xa0percent of COVID-19 cases are \"totally harmless\".[512][513]He began insisting that all states should resume in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases.[514]Political pressure on health agenciesMain article:Political interference with science agencies by the first Trump administrationTrump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[510]such as approving unproven treatments[515][516]or speeding up vaccine approvals.[516]Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump\\'s claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[517][518]Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \"deep state\" opposing him and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[519]Outbreak at the White HouseMain article:White House COVID-19 outbreakTrump boardsMarine Onefor COVID-19 treatment on October\\xa02, 2020On October\\xa02, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive forCOVID-19, part of a White House outbreak.[520]Later that dayTrump was hospitalizedatWalter Reed National Military Medical Center, reportedly due to fever and labored breathing. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October\\xa05, still infectious and unwell.[521][522]During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus.[521]In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case.[522]In January 2021, he received a COVID-19 vaccination.[523]Effects on the 2020 presidential campaignBy July 2020, Trump\\'s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue in the presidential election.[524]Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue.[525]Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[524]and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with anIpsos/ABC Newspoll indicating 65\\xa0percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.[526]In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly said that the U.S. was \"rounding the turn\" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing cases and deaths.[527]A few days before the November\\xa03 election, the U.S. reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[528]InvestigationsAfter he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, hisprivate businesses, personal taxes, andcharitable foundation.[529]There were ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.[530]FinancialIn April 2019, theHouse Oversight Committeeissuedsubpoenasseeking financial details from Trump\\'s banks, Deutsche Bank andCapital One, and his accounting firm,Mazars USA. Trump sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chairElijah Cummingsto prevent the disclosures.[531]In May,DC District CourtjudgeAmit Mehtaruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[532]and judgeEdgardo Ramosof theSouthern District Court of New Yorkruled that the banks must also comply.[533][534]Trump\\'s attorneys appealed.[535]In September 2022, the committee and Trump agreed to a settlement about Mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents.[536]Russian election interferenceMain articles:Russian interference in the 2016 United States electionsandTimelines related to Donald Trump and Russian interference in United States electionsSee also:Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential electionandSteele dossierIn January 2017, American intelligence agenciesâ€”theCIA, theFBI, and theNSA, represented by theDirector of National Intelligenceâ€”jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[537][538]In March 2017, FBI DirectorJames Comeytold Congress, \"[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\\'s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\\'s efforts.\"[539]Many suspicious[540]links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spieswere discovered and the relationships between Russians and \"team Trump\", including Manafort, Flynn, and Stone, were widely reported by the press.[541][542][543][544]Members of Trump\\'s campaign and his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the election.[545][546]On December\\xa029, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian AmbassadorSergey Kislyakabout sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence.[547]Trump told Kislyak andSergei Lavrovin May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.[548]Trump and his allies promoteda conspiracy theorythat Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 electionâ€”which was also promoted by Russia toframeUkraine.[549]FBI Crossfire Hurricane and 2017 counterintelligence investigationsIn July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamedCrossfire Hurricane, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.[550]After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump\\'s personal andbusiness dealings with Russia.[551]Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,[552]but Deputy Attorney GeneralRod Rosensteinended the investigation into Trump\\'s direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that theRobert Mueller\\'s special counsel investigation would pursue the matter.[553][554]Mueller investigationMain articles:Mueller special counsel investigation,Mueller report, andCriminal charges brought in the Mueller special counsel investigationIn May 2017, Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Muellerspecial counselfor theDepartment of Justice(DOJ), ordering him to \"examine \\'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government\\' and the Trump campaign\". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters \"in connection with Russia\\'s 2016 election interference\".[553]The special counsel also investigated whether Trump\\'sdismissal of James Comeyas FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[555]and the Trump campaign\\'s possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,Turkey,Qatar, Israel, and China.[556]Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times, but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.[557]In March 2019, Mueller gavehis final reportto Attorney GeneralWilliam Barr,[558]which Barr purported to summarizein a letter to Congress. A federal court, and Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation\\'s conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public.[559][560][561]Trump repeatedly claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not.[562]A redacted version of the report, publicly released in April 2019, found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump.[563]Despite \"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", the report found that the prevailing evidence \"did not establish\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.[564][565]The report revealed sweeping Russian interference[565]and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing it would benefit them electorally.[566][567][568][569]The report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump, but \"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\\'s conduct\".[570][571]Investigators decided they could not \"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\" as anOffice of Legal Counselopinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted,[572]and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[573]The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \"may apply the obstruction laws\".[572]The House of Representatives subsequently launched animpeachment inquiryfollowing theTrumpâ€“Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.[574][575]Several Trump associates pleaded guilty or were convicted in connection with Mueller\\'s investigation and related cases, including Manafort[576]and Flynn.[577][578]Trump\\'s former attorneyMichael Cohenpleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump\\'s 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to builda Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump.[579]In February 2020, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for lying to Congress and witness tampering. The sentencing judge said Stone \"was prosecuted for covering up for the president\".[580]First impeachmentMain articles:First impeachment of Donald TrumpandTrumpâ€“Ukraine scandalMembers of House of Representatives vote on twoarticles of impeachment(H.Res.\\xa0755), December\\xa018, 2019In August 2019, awhistleblowerfiled a complaint with theInspector General of the Intelligence Communityabout a July\\xa025 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his sonHunter.[581]The whistleblower said that the White House had attempted to cover up the incident and that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Trump attorneyRudy Giulianithat may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence\\'s May 2019 Ukraine trip.[582]House SpeakerNancy Pelosiinitiateda formal impeachment inquiryon September\\xa024.[583]Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision.[584][585]On September\\xa025, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr.[581][586]The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump\\'s personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.[587]In October,William B. Taylor Jr., thechargÃ© d\\'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment to investigate the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[588]He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.[589]On December\\xa013, theHouse Judiciary Committeevoted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: one forabuse of powerand one forobstruction of Congress.[590]After debate, the House of RepresentativesimpeachedTrump on both articles on December\\xa018.[591]Trump displaying the headline \"Trump acquitted\"During the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and asserted that Trump\\'s actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the impeachment process.[592]Trump\\'s lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges, but said that Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.[593]They argued that the impeachment was \"constitutionally and legally invalid\" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.[593]On January\\xa031, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents.[594]The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.[595]Trump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority. SenatorMitt Romneywas the only Republican who voted to convict Trump on one charge, the abuse of power.[596]Following his acquittal, Trump fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.[597]Second impeachmentMain articles:Second impeachment of Donald TrumpandSecond impeachment trial of Donald TrumpSpeaker of the HouseNancy Pelosisigning the second impeachment of TrumpOn January\\xa011, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump withincitement of insurrectionagainst the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[598]The House voted 232â€“197 to impeach Trump on January\\xa013, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.[599]Ten Republicans voted for the impeachmentâ€”the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[600]On February\\xa013, following afive-day Senate trial, Trump was acquitted when the Senate vote fell ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president.[601][602]Most Republicans voted to acquit Trump, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (Trump had left office on January\\xa020; the Senate voted 56â€“44 that the trial was constitutional).[603]Election of 2020 and post-presidencyDefeat by BidenMain articles:2020 United States presidential electionandDonald Trump 2020 presidential campaignBreaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[604]He held his first reelection rally less than a month after taking office[605]and officially became theRepublican nomineein August 2020.[606]In his first two years in office, Trump\\'s reelection committee reported raising $67.5\\xa0million and began 2019 with $19.3\\xa0million in cash.[607]By July 2020, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1\\xa0billion and spent $800\\xa0million, losing their cash advantage over Biden.[608]The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.[609]Trump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won.[610]He repeatedly misrepresented Biden\\'s positions[611][612]and shifted to appeals to racism.[613]Starting in the spring of 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.[614][615]When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25\\xa0billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, he blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail, creating acrisis in the Postal Service.[616]He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results if he lost and commit to apeaceful transition of power.[617][618]Biden won the election on November\\xa03, receiving 81.3\\xa0million votes (51.3\\xa0percent) to Trump\\'s 74.2\\xa0million (46.8\\xa0percent)[619][620]and 306Electoral Collegevotes to Trump\\'s 232.[621]Rejection of resultsFurther information:Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election,2020â€“21 United States election protests, andElection denial movement in the United StatesAt 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[622]After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump stated that \"this election is far from over\" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[623]He and his allies filed manylegal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both thestateandfederal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[624][625]His allegations were also refuted by state election officials.[626]AfterCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security AgencydirectorChris Krebscontradicted Trump\\'s fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November\\xa017.[627]On December\\xa011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to heara case from the Texas attorney generalthat asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[628]Trump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election.[629]He initially blocked government officials from cooperating inBiden\\'s presidential transition.[630][631]After three weeks, the administrator of theGeneral Services Administrationdeclared Biden the \"apparent winner\" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.[632]Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.[633][634]The Electoral College formalized Biden\\'s victory on December\\xa014.[621]From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help tooverturn the results, personally pressuring Republican local and state office-holders,[635]Republican state and federal legislators,[636]the Justice Department,[637]and Vice President Pence,[638]urging various actions such asreplacing presidential electors, or a request for Georgia officials to \"find\" votes and announce a \"recalculated\" result.[636]On February\\xa010, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump\\'s efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.[639]Trump did not attendBiden\\'s inauguration.[640]January 6 Capitol attackMain article:January 6 United States Capitol attackFor a chronological guide, seeTimeline of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.Trump speaking at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January\\xa06.In December 2020,Newsweekreportedthe Pentagonwas on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what to do if Trump declaredmartial law. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role in the outcome of elections.[641]When Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of StaffMark Milleyand CIA directorGina Haspelbecame concerned about a possiblecoupattempt or military action against China or Iran.[642][643]Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons.[644][645]On January\\xa06, 2021, whilecongressional certification of the presidential election resultswas taking place in the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a noon rally atthe Ellipsein Washington, D.C., where he called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and \"take back our country\" by marching to the Capitol.[646][647]Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. The mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.[648]During the violence, Trump posted messages onTwitterwithout asking the rioters to disperse. At 6\\xa0p.m., he tweeted that the rioters should \"go home with love & in peace\", calling them \"great patriots\" and repeating that the election was stolen.[649]After the mob was removed, Congress reconvened and confirmed Biden\\'s win in the early hours of the following morning.[650]According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died.[651][652]In March 2023, Trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on asong to benefit the prisoners, and in June, he said that, if elected, he would pardon many of them.[653]Status during post-presidencySee also:Personal and business legal affairs of Donald TrumpandLegal affairs of Donald Trump as presidentTrump lives at his Mar-a-Lago club, having established an office there as provided for by theFormer Presidents Act.[93][654][655]Trump is entitled to live there legally as a club employee.[656][657]Trump\\'s false claimsconcerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the \"big lie\" in the press and by his critics. In May 2021, Trump and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself.[658][659]The Republican Party used Trump\\'s false election narrative to justify theimposition of new voting restrictionsin its favor.[659][660]As late as July 2022, Trump was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the 2020 election.[661]Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; he has been described as a modernparty boss. He continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on how elections are run and on ousting election officials who had resisted his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results.

By May 2021, theNational Archives and Records Administration(NARA) realized that important documents had not been turned over to them and asked his office to locate them. In January 2022, they retrieved 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA later informed the Department of Justice that some of the retrieved documents were classified material.[674]The Justice Department began an investigation[675]and sent Trump a subpoena for additional material.[674]Justice Department officials visited Mar-a-Lago and received some classified documents from Trump\\'s lawyers,[674]one of whom signed a statement affirming that all material marked as classified had been returned.[676]On August\\xa08, 2022, FBI agents searched Mar-a-Lago to recover government documents and material Trump had taken with him when he left office in violation of thePresidential Records Act,[677][678]reportedly including some related to nuclear weapons.[679]The search warrant indicates an investigation of potential violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice laws.[680]The items taken in the search included 11 sets of classified documents, four of them tagged as \"top secret\" and one as \"top secret/SCI\", the highest level of classification.[677][678]On November\\xa018, 2022, U.S. attorney generalMerrick Garlandappointed federal prosecutorJack Smithas aspecial counselto oversee the federal criminal investigations into Trump retaining government property at Mar-a-Lago andexamining Trump\\'s role in the events leading up to the Capitol attack.[681][682]Criminal referral by the House January 6 CommitteeMain article:United States House Select Committee on the January 6 AttackOn December\\xa019, 2022, theUnited States House Select Committee on the January\\xa06 Attackrecommended criminal charges against Trump forobstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and inciting or assisting an insurrection.[683]Federal and state criminal indictmentsMain articles:Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (classified documents case),Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case), andGeorgia election racketeering prosecutionIn December 2022, following a jury trial, the Trump Organization wasconvicted on 17 countsof criminal tax fraud, conspiracy, and falsifying business records in connection with a tax-fraud scheme stretching over 15 years.

Trump said he would appeal the verdict. The judge also ordered the company to be overseen by the monitor appointed by the court in 2023 and an independent director of compliance, and that any \"restructuring and potential dissolution\" would be the decision of the monitor.[720]In May 2023, a New York jury in a federal lawsuit brought by journalistE. Jean Carrollin 2022 (\"Carroll II\") found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation and ordered him to pay her $5\\xa0million.[721]Trump asked for a new trial or a reduction of the award, arguing that the jury had not found him liable for rape. He also separately countersued Carroll for defamation.

He was also projected to become the first Republican in two decades to secure the popular vote in the U.S. presidential elections.[773]AssessmentsPublic imageMain article:Public image of Donald TrumpSee also:Donald Trump in popular cultureTrump was the only president never to reach a 50\\xa0percent approval rating in theGallup poll, which dates to 1938, partially due to a record-high partisan gap in his approval ratings: 88\\xa0percent among Republicans and 7\\xa0percent among Democrats.[774]Trump\\'s early ratings were unusually stable, ranging between 35 and 49\\xa0percent.[775]He finished his term with a rating between 29 and 34\\xa0percentâ€”the lowest of any president since modern polling beganâ€”and a record-low average of 41\\xa0percent throughout his presidency.[774][776]InGallup\\'s annual pollasking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for first in 2019, and placed first in 2020.[777][778]SinceGallupstarted conducting the poll in 1946, Trump was the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office.[779]A Gallup poll in 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between 2016 and 2017 found that Trump led Obama in job approval in only 29 countries, most of them non-democracies;[780]approval of U.S. leadership plummeted among allies and G7 countries. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of theGeorge W. Bush administration.[781]By mid-2020, only 16\\xa0percent of international respondents to a 13-nationPew Researchpoll expressed confidence in Trump, lower than China\\'sXi Jinpingand Russia\\'sVladimir Putin.[782]ScholarlyFurther information:Historical rankings of presidents of the United States Â§\\xa02021 C-SPANIn theC-SPAN\"Presidential Historians Survey 2021\",[783]historians ranked Trump as the fourth-worst president.

He tweeted frequently during his 2016 campaign and as president until Twitter banned him after the January\\xa06 attack, in the final days of his term.[836]Trump often used Twitter to communicate directly with the public and sideline the press.[837]In June 2017, the White House press secretary said that Trump\\'s tweets were official presidential statements.[838]After years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checks in May 2020.[839]In response, Trump tweeted that social media platforms \"totally silence\" conservatives and that he would \"strongly regulate, or close them down\".[840]In the days after the storming of the Capitol, Trump was banned fromFacebook,Instagram, Twitter and other platforms.[841]The loss of his social media presence diminished his ability to shape events[842][843]and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter.[844]Trump\\'s early attempts to reestablish a social media presence were unsuccessful.[845]In February 2022, he launched social media platformTruth Socialwhere he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.[846]Elon Musk, afteracquiring Twitter, reinstated Trump\\'s Twitter account in November 2022.[847][848]Meta Platforms\\' two-year ban lapsed in January 2023, allowing Trump to return to Facebook and Instagram,[849]although in 2024, Trump continued to call the company an \"enemy of the people\".[850]Relationship with the pressFurther information:First presidency of Donald Trump Â§\\xa0Relationship with the news mediaTrump talking to the press, March 2017Trump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a \"love-hate\" relationship with the press.[851]In the 2016 campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[190]The New York TimeswriterAmy Chozickwrote in 2018 that Trump\\'s media dominance enthralled the public and created \"must-see TV\".[852]As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the \"fake news media\" and \"theenemy of the people\".[853][854]In 2018, journalistLesley Stahlsaid that Trump had privately told her that he intentionally discredited the media \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[855]As president, Trump mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical.[856]His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[857]The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.[857]Trump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press.[858]In early 2020, the Trump campaign suedThe New York Times,The Washington Post, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference.[859][860]All the suits were dismissed.[861][862][863]Notes^This cut taxes and eliminated, effective 2019, theindividual mandatepenalty of theAffordable Care Act.^Neil Gorsuch(2017),Brett Kavanaugh(2018), andAmy Coney Barrett(2020)^Most notably, the proposedTrans-Pacific Partnershiptrade agreement (withdrew in 2017), theParis Agreementon climate change (withdrew in 2020), and theIran nuclear deal(withdrew in 2018)^Related tohis hush money paymentto adult film actressStormy Daniels^Attributed to multiple references:[747][748][749][750][751][752][753][754][755][756][757][758][759]^Attributed to multiple sources:[789][790][791][792][793][794][795][page\\xa0needed][796][page\\xa0needed][797]References^Kranish & Fisher 2017, pp.\\xa030, 37.^Kranish & Fisher 2017, p.\\xa0v.^Horowitz, Jason (September 22, 2015).\"Donald Trump\\'s Old Queens Neighborhood Contrasts With the Diverse Area Around It\".The New York Times.

Due to the sheer volume of books about Trump, the titles listed here are limited to non-fiction books about Trump or his presidency, published bynotableauthors and scholars. Tertiary sources (including textbooks and juvenile literature), satire, and self-published books are excluded.Prior to his2016 campaign, Trump was already the focus of many books describing his life as a businessman and politician.[1]BiographerMichael D\\'Antonioobserved inNever Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success(2015) that Trump \"has been a topic of conversation in America for almost 40 years. No one in the world of business\\xa0– not Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Warren Buffett\\xa0– has been as famous as Trump for as long.\" Almost one year after his inauguration as president,The Guardiannoted that more than 4,500 English-language books about Trump had been published since he took office, compared to just over 800 works about Trump\\'s predecessorBarack Obamaduring his first year in office.[2]This \"Trump bump\" for the U.S. publishing industry, asThe New York Timesput it, persisted throughout his time in office.[3]But afterwards, demand for books about his presidency dropped off sharply.[4]Trump\\'s first published book in 1987 wasTrump: The Art of the Deal, written byghostwriterTony Schwartz.[1][5][6]Trump made a practice of hiring ghostwriters and co-authors to write his books.[7][8][9]In some cases the ghostwriters are credited on the cover, while in other instances, includingTime to Get Tough(2011) andCrippled America(2015), Trump makes mention of the writer\\'s contributions in the acknowledgements sections. Works written by Trump himself includeself-help books,personal financebooks, political policy treatises, andautobiographies.[1][10]\"...Schwartz has noted that, during the year and a half that they worked together onThe Art of the Deal, he never saw a single book in Trump\\'s office or apartment. Yet Trump has taken authorial credits on more than a dozen books to date, and, given that he\\'s a proven marketing master, it\\'s inconceivable that he won\\'t try to sell more.\"[11]The Washington PostjournalistCarlos Lozadaobserved that a continuous theme throughout Trump\\'s written works is a focus on Trump himself, such as citing examples from his business inreal estate investingand work on television. Parties and individuals discussed in books by Trump are reduced to azero-sum game, according to Lozada: \"Trump\\'s world isbinary, divided into class acts and total losers.\" Trump often makes use ofhyperboleto illustrate his points in his works. In other books, Trump repeats the same stories of what he views as key successes from his business career; for example, a tale about a 1980s business deal improving theWollman RinkinCentral Park, New York.[10]Trump\\'s published writings shifted post-2000, from generally memoirs about himself to books giving advice about finance.[10]Credited to Trump[edit]Further information:Media career of Donald TrumpTitleYearPublisherISBN / OCLCGhostwriter(s)NotesTrump: The Art of the Deal1987Random House978-0-345-47917-4Tony Schwartz[5][6]It reached number 1 onThe New York TimesBest Seller list, stayed there for 13 weeks, and altogether held a position on the list for 48 weeks.Schwartz discussed his alleged ghostwriting, in a 2016 article inThe New Yorker.[12]Trump: Surviving at the Top1990Random House978-0-394-57597-1Charles Leerhsen[13]Subsequently, as:The Art of Survival(1991),ISBN978-0-446-36209-2Trump: The Art of the Comeback1997Times Books978-0-8129-2964-5Kate Bohner[14]The America We Deserve2000Renaissance Books978-1-580-63131-0Dave Shiflett[15]Published during decision-making process for theDonald Trump presidential campaign, 2000.[16]Trump: How to Get Rich2004Random House978-0-345-48103-0Meredith McIver[17][18]The Way to the Top: The Best Business Advice I Ever Received2004Crown Business978-1-4000-5016-1Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life2004Random House978-0-345-48140-5Meredith McIver[18]The Best Golf Advice I Ever Received2005Crown978-0-307-20999-3Why We Want You to Be Rich2006Rich Press978-1-933914-02-2Meredith McIver[18]Robert Kiyosakias coauthor.
